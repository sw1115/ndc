<h1>Dominican Republic: Nationally Determined Contribution 2020</h1>
<p>December 2020</p>



<p>The Dominican Republic (DR) reaffirms its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In the process of improving and updating the Nationally Determined Contribution of RD 2020 (NDC-RD 2020), the country's climate commitments are established by 2030, the elements that will guide the national climate action plan and, at the same time, the structures and governance arrangements that will allow progress towards an economy low in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resilient to the effects and impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>The NDC-RD 2020 was developed within the framework of a <strong>participatory, inclusive, dynamic, cross-cutting and multisectoral process,</strong> addressing the different views and visions of all the actors in the Dominican territory. An <strong>increase in ambition is established in all components</strong>that integrate it, incorporating new elements and providing greater clarity and transparency, all of this addressed from the framework of the country's strategic planning. It represents the instrument that guides national climate action, helping to stop the increase in the global average temperature, to increase the resilience of the country and the planet, as well as to mobilize public and private investments in the path of sustainable development, which consider environmental, social and economic variables in a balanced way.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic, in its NDC 2020, increases its climate ambition by committing itself to reducing <strong>GHG emissions by 27% with respect to BAU or <em>business as usual</em></strong> by 2030. This with a target of <strong>20% conditioned on external finances and 7% Unconditional to domestic finances, this being distributed in 5% corresponding to the private sector and 2% to the public sector. </strong><strong>46 mitigation options</strong> are presented <strong></strong>distributed in: 27 options identified and evaluated for the <strong>Energy sector</strong> (focused on electricity generation, energy efficiency and road transport), 4 options identified and evaluated for the <strong>Sector of Use of Products and Industrial Processes (IPPU ),</strong>10 options identified for the <strong>Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU)</strong> sectors and 5 for the <strong>Waste</strong> sector <strong>. </strong>The country proposes to achieve, from evaluated and proposed <strong>mitigation options</strong> , to reduce <strong>13,853.71 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq, which represents 27.16% with respect to the BAU 2030 scenario, estimated at 51 thousand Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq,</strong> with an estimated required investment of <strong>USD $ 8,916,950,000.00 expressed as conditioned and unconditioned form</strong> .</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>adaptation to climate change,</strong> important adjustments are incorporated including measures in areas of special urgency to build a more resilient country, incorporating measurable goals for the new prioritized sectors. The priorities are presented in <strong>37 measures</strong> distributed in the <strong>sectors of water security, food security, health, resilient cities (infrastructures, human settlements), coastal-marine resources, tourism and ecosystems, biodiversity and forests. </strong>The country estimates an <strong>upward investment required for adaptation to climate change at USD $ 8,715,787,193</strong>expressed in investments, especially in the sectors of water security, food security and resilient cities. While in the other sectors a lower investment is reflected and it is based more on strengthening the enabling frameworks for the implementation of adaptation measures in the 2021-2030 period.</p>
<p>Aspects of inclusion and <strong>gender</strong> equity <strong> the role of youth, the role of cities and municipalities, human rights and just transition</strong>are highlighted as cross-cutting elements of climate action, essential for the successful implementation of the country's NDC. Likewise, the design and implementation of a <strong>National Action Strategy for Climate Empowerment (ACE) is established,</strong> which identifies 24 priority goals for the six elements.</p>
<p>The NDC-RD 2020 places great emphasis on strengthening its domestic <strong>governance</strong> system , as well as the capacities of its key institutions to enable the effective implementation of its decarbonization and adaptation objectives, to ensure a close integration between climate change and the development priorities. Likewise, it reaffirms the present and future efforts of the <strong>design, development and implementation of the Reinforced National Framework of Climate Transparency,</strong> with the bases of Decree 541-20 (Establishment of the National System of Measurement, Reporting and Verification [MRV] of GHG), through Of which it covers and enables all mitigation and adaptation measures implemented in the country, making their results and effectiveness transparent.</p>
<p>Regarding the means of implementation, coherence with the country's long-term climate objectives is highlighted, ensuring that the <strong>creation and strengthening of capacities, the development and transfer of technologies, together with climate financing</strong> , respond to the priorities established from long-term climate goals. The NDC-RD 2020 clearly indicates the need to <strong>align the national planning processes,</strong> so that the policies, measures and actions to implement the NDC and the fulfillment of the national Sustainable Development agenda by 2030 can be related to the <strong>Objectives. of Sustainable Development (ODS).</strong> The country is developing and it will take a reasonable time to achieve more ambitious goals, based on equity and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.</p>

<p>During the technical dialogue workshops and subsequent discussions of the NDC RD 2020 Improvement and Update Process, general goals and enabling frameworks for climate action for municipalities were identified, such as:</p><p>


</p><ul>
  <li>Creation and implementation of municipal plans for land use planning and adaptation to climate change.</li>
  <li>Promotion of regulations and initiatives that promote sustainable mobility in municipalities.</li>
<li>Promotion of the establishment of green areas.</li>
<li>Develop and implement training and awareness campaigns on climate action from municipal governments.</li>
<li>Increase efforts for comprehensive waste management following the principles of circular economy models and sustainable consumption.</li>

<p>The NDC-RD 2020 was developed on the analytical basis reviewed in the documents expressed above, as well as other documents and sector studies that reflect the results of the validated mitigation options and the proposals, as well as a review in the instruments of the national policy on the issue of climate change as enabling frameworks for analysis and approval.</p>
<p>Based on the information reviewed and the support received by the technical assistance for the sectors; The entire process began with a timeline at the national level, beginning with a launch workshop, followed by a series of sectoral technical dialogues with identified and proposed mitigation options in the sectors.</p>
<p>The options identified, based on the technical assistance of the World Bank for the Energy sector, were evaluated using an innovative weighting methodology established by the coordinating team in six technical sessions with the country's sectors, subsequently analyzes were carried out with the energy sectors. bilateral form; culminating in a process of discussion of the results of the process of improvement and updating of the NDC-RD 2020 with the members of the Direct Committee.</p>




<p>The mitigation options proposed from the DECCC-2011 Plan, for the AFOLU and Waste sectors were reviewed, the first sector had a technical dialogue with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of the Environment and the second sector had a more general analysis with the advisor to the Minister of the Environment and Natural Resources for such purposes.</p>

<p>Updating the national projections of GHG emissions and removals to reflect the latest available data and forecasts provides a quantitative basis where the GHG reduction goals are established with greater transparency, taking as a reference the INGEI calculations in the Third National Communication of Climate Change published in UNFCCC 2018, taking 2010 as the last year of the inventory and the data from the INGEI update published in the fBUR-2020 were reviewed, taking 2015 as the last year of the inventory.</p>
<p>Taking into account both INGEI and the increase in GHG emissions in the country, an improvement and update scenario is considered "with specific options", considering the most recent GDP growth forecasts, the technological and associated cost assumptions have been evaluated for each option, and other determining factors in emission trends, as well as the expected impacts of the policies and measures approved (Enabling Frameworks) and applied to implement the options in the country.</p>
<p>This new scenario allows the country to see a clearer path so that the global commitments to reduce emissions in force can be met with the intention of avoiding an increase in the global average temperature by 1.5 ° or 2 °C in the medium and long term .</p>
<p>In accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the Dominican Republic will continue with a process of continuous improvement for the presentation of GHG reports in the sectors with the greatest uncertainty where AFOLU (specifically Agriculture and Soil Uses) and Waste are included, which It will involve continuous training for the actors involved and a proposal for updating through its own methodologies for collecting activity data in the categories that occur in the country and identifying the necessary investments for those sectors.</p>
<p>To avoid double counting of GHG emissions, in 2020 the Dominican Republic issued Presidential Decree 541-20 that creates the National System of Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of GHGs of the Dominican Republic, with the objective of accounting GHG emissions and record all mitigation actions, as well as the support given and received from financing aimed at promoting climate actions.</p>

<p>Technical-sectoral work tables were implemented with the participation and transparency of the process with various actors, making contributions to an improved, updated and clarified document, which corresponds to the new proposals of clearer goals and more realistic objectives for the strengthening of the strategies of climate action of the country.</p>
<p>These dialogue workshops were attended by sector ministries, private sector actors, subnational officials, civil society, academia, international cooperation partners, independent consultants and specialists in related topics, and were divided into nine sector tables.</p>
<p>Up to 25 face-to-face participants participated in each table, including the coordinating team and all the tables had the participation of experts, specialists and technicians from virtuality.</p>
<p>Once the workshops were organized, a Weighting Matrix was presented with 17 criteria to place a weighting of 0-5 points, notation keys: Not estimated (N / E) and Not applicable (N / A), prepared by the coordinating team of the NDCRD 2020, according to international methodologies provided by the World Resource Institute (WRI) for the sectors in the aforementioned tables, to classify the mitigation options and adaptation measures in a cross-sectional way related to the issues, to know the impact of each in the other and their co-benefits.</p>


<p>Initiative to Support National Planning Actions (SNAP) of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), through the calculation tool LEAP-IBC 2020.1.0.7 (32-Bit), presents a characterization that consists of both greenhouse gases greenhouse (carbon dioxide [CO <sub>2</sub> ] and methane [CH <sub>4</sub> ]) as short-lived climate pollutants CCVC (black carbon [CN] and methane [CH <sub>4</sub> ]) and other air pollutants (particulate matter [PM <sub>2.5</sub> and PM <sub>10</sub> ], nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO <sub>2</sub> ), ammonia (NH <sub>3</sub> ), organic carbon (OC), volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC) and carbon monoxide (CO).</p>
<p>From this study, an evaluation of the mitigation actions for short-lived climate pollutants (CCVC) was carried out, quantifying the potential to reduce these CCVC and the emissions of air pollutants of 5 mitigation measures included in existing plans and strategies in Dominican Republic, which should be worked with better transparency based on the NDC action plan. Overall, implementing these measures could reduce black carbon emissions by 6% in 2030 compared to a baseline scenario, and methane emissions by 1%. These same actions were also shown to substantially reduce CO <sub>2</sub>emissions<sub></sub>and a variety of other air pollutants. Therefore, they are relevant for consideration in updating the Nationally Determined Contribution of the Dominican Republic and can be reported as of 2025.</p>

<p>The Dominican Republic, through the referenced articles, improves and updates its NDC with respect to the provisions of the Paris Agreement, including the achievement of its most ambitious objective of reducing 27% of emissions with respect to the BAU 2030 scenario, better expressing its ambition in terms of climate investments to comply with the global agreement and its indicators.</p>
<p>In the Energy Sector, according to the options identified and evaluated, based on technical assistance from the World Bank, UN Environment, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the subsectors were worked on of electricity generation, energy efficiency and road transport, where it is necessary to mobilize USD $ 4,316,950,000.00, to reduce 5,778.85 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq, which corresponds to an 11.33% reduction in emissions by 2030.</p>
<p>Additionally, for the Energy Sector, according to “REMAP, IRENA-2016”, with the participation of the National Energy Commission, scenarios are forecast in REMAP with an estimated potential in wind farms of 2,304 MWp and for the installation of solar panels in residential spaces, services and solar farms an estimated potential of 1,761 MWp throughout the national territory. And finally, 900 MWp could be displaced based on natural gas, the fossil fuel with the lowest global warming power according to the IPCC Reports.</p>
<p>Taking into account the aforementioned explanation, the country could increase the identification and evaluation of the additional options proposed in wind energy 954 MWp installed, solar photovoltaic 958 MWp installed with capacity factors of 34% and 18% respectively and the reconversion or displacement of 900MWp to natural gas in the No. 6 fuel oil-based plants and the most obsolete coal-based plants in the country's electricity generation and a capacity factor of 70%, both for the National Interconnected Electric System (SENI), and plants that generate in isolated systems such as the Punta Cana-Macao Energy Consortium (CEPCM).</p>
<p>For these options, according to the REMAP study and the decrease in prices for wind and solar technologies, an investment of USD $ 2,500,000,000.00 and a reduction of 3,207.86 GgCO <sub>2eq is estimated</sub> , which corresponds to a 6.29% reduction in emissions by 2030.</p>
<p>In summary, in the Energy sector it could be more ambitious according to related studies, where other additional options for energy efficiency and transport in general can be evaluated. The country needs, based on the options evaluated and the renewable and natural gas proposals, to mobilize approximately USD $ 6,816,950,000.00 and reduce 8,986.71 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq, which represents a 17.62% reduction in emissions to the BAU 2030 scenario in total in the NDC-RD 2020.</p>
<p>The IPPU Sector, with the options evaluated, plans to mobilize approximately USD $ 248,000,000.00 and could reduce 732 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eqby 2030, which means 1.43% reduction to the proposed goal.</p>
<p>Taking the DECCC-2011 Plan as a reference and the bilateral exchanges with the sectors specifically, other options were qualitatively identified in the AFOLU sectors (estimated reduction of 2,013 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq) and Waste (estimated reduction of 2,112 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eq) that may reach to 4,135 GgCO<sub>2</sub>eqby 2030, which may mean an 8.11% reduction with respect to BAU, and would need to mobilize an estimated investment of USD $ 1,852,000,000.00, according to the technologies evaluated in the studies indicated above.</p>
<p>The country proposes to achieve, from the evaluated and proposed <strong>mitigation options</strong> , reduce <strong>13,853.71 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq, which represents 27.16% with respect to the BAU 2030 scenario, estimated at 51 thousand Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq,</strong> with an estimated investment of <strong>8,916,950,000.00 US dollars expressed in the form conditioned and unconditional</strong> , bearing in mind that the country is developing and will take a reasonable time to achieve more ambitious goals, based on equity and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.</p>

<p>Adaptation to climate change is a constitutional priority established in its article 194. The National Development Strategy (Law 1-12) establishes in its axis 4 promoting adequate adaptation to climate change. Likewise, the PNACC has as its vision the time horizon of 2030, since it is consistent with the studies, plans carried out in the DR, in addition to Law 01-12 on the National Development Strategy; as well as taking into account that a plan of this nature is a continuous process and that it will readjust to the new and changing complex realities that compose it.</p>
<p>Regarding national adaptation objectives, the PNACC establishes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, by building the capacity for adaptation and resilience.</li>
<li>Facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation, in a consistent manner, into new and existing policies, programs and activities, in particular development planning processes and strategies, within all relevant sectors and at different levels, as appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Six strategic axes were established, each one with more specific focus areas, objectives and lines of action. The axes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Water Security Sector (drinking water) and Food Security Sector (agriculture)</li>
<li>Climate Resilient Cities Sector (infrastructures, human settlements) - Health Sector</li>
<li>Ecosystems, Biodiversity and Forests Sector.</li>

<strong>2. Scenarios of climate change, impacts, risks and vulnerabilities</strong>

<td>to. Projections of future changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme indices</td>
<td>
<p>The country has climate projections made by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics for Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC) presented at the TCNCC. Similarly, projections made by the Global Water Partnership (GWP) are added within the Climate Action Improvement Package (CAEP) initiative. These scenarios also show projections on temperature, landslides, and drought.</p>

<p>Within the framework of the TCNCC, CATHALAC carried out the simulation of national climate scenarios based on models of the selected regions of the country, and analysis of the impact of said scenarios on the country's water, food and energy security. These scenarios are projections towards 2050 and 2070.</p>
<p>Regarding the TCNCC scenarios, we can generally indicate that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum temperatures will increase between 1 ° C and up to 3 ° C by 2050 and will reach change values ​​of between 2 ° C and up to 6 ° C by 2070, where only the province of Independencia (Jimaní) may present negative changes (temperatures colder) between -1 ° C and -2 ° C during the rainy season. By 2070, the changes will increase more than between 2 ° C and up to 6 ° C, with the changes being more evident in the provinces of Barahona, Monte Plata, La Romana, Hato Mayor and San Juan, the latter being the most extreme.</li>
<li>Maximum temperatures will have a more marked, generalized increase and may increase from between 2 ° C and 3 ° C by 2050 and from 3 ° C to 5 ° C by 2070. There is the exception of the provinces of Samaná and Independencia, which they may show changes, but with values ​​close to their natural variability, which today shows changes of between 1 ° C and 3 ° C. It is highlighted that the provinces of Barahona, Monte Plata, Distrito Nacional, Hato Mayor and San Juan will be where these changes may be more noticeable.</li>
<li>The dry season (December-April) may intensify even more towards 2050 and 2070. At a specific level and under any type of radiative forcing, the models mostly coincide in a decrease in total rainfall of up to 50% with respect to historical values. in the provinces of Independencia, Puerto Plata, San Juan and Santiago, as well as decreases of between 10 and 30% in provinces such as Samaná, Distrito Nacional, La Altagracia, Barahona and Hato Mayor.</li>
<li>The beginning of the rains could present a sudden increase in the total accumulated rain both towards 2050 and 2070. There is a coincidence in the results of the models in both time horizons of presenting increases of more than 100% (mainly in Herrera, Barahona and San Juan). This result is consistent with the occurrence of a more intensified diurnal cycle and with a greater capacity to present extreme rain events.</li>

<li>The total annual precipitation by 2050 will decrease by 15% when averaging throughout the national territory, worsening to values ​​of 17% by 2070, compared to the historical values ​​of 1961-1990. The consistency of the results between the models under a radiative forcing of 8.5 W / m2 is 87%.</li>
<li>The southern and western provinces of the country will be the most affected by the decrease in rainfall towards 2050 and 2070, while the eastern and northern provinces could even show even small positive changes. The condition of decrease in total annual precipitation could be further accentuated by 2050/2070 in the regions: Ozama (18% / 20%), Valdesia (17.5% / 20%), Enriquillo (17% / 20%), Higuamo (16% / 18%) and Cibao Sur (15% / 17%). The other regions could experience changes of less than 15%. Only one model shows positive values ​​towards 2050 in Cibao Noroeste (1.3%), Cibao Norte (0.9%) and Yuma (0.1%) where it even only increases in Yuma (4.5%) towards 2070.</li>
</ul>

<p>Related to the climate scenarios developed under the CAEP initiative by GWP we can mention the following key results:</p>

<p>Related to the maps of susceptibility to landslides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally high susceptibility to the northeast of the islands in most scenarios, which can be the result of the combination of two main factors, that is, the sloping and relief rain falls from the moisture-laden winds of the Atlantic.</li>
<li>The northwest of the country maintained low susceptibility values ​​in all five but one.</li>
</ul>


<p>Related to the risk of landslide we have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>High correlation with areas of high population and construction density and susceptibility.</li>
<li>The highest values ​​are observed in the vicinity of the capital, Santo Domingo and Puerto Plata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Related to precipitation projections:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Extreme precipitation rates: the model predictions for 2030 and 2070 reflect a dominant level of susceptibility in Santo Domingo.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2030, very high susceptibility to flooding is visible in the southeast of the DR in both models. the</p></li>
  <li> The HadGEM45 R99 model reflects a very high susceptibility in both epochs: </li>
<ul><li>When natural vegetation is replaced by an impermeable surface in these regions, it disrupts the hydrological cycle, increasing stormwater runoff and reducing groundwater recharge.</li>

<li><p>More precipitation is forecast in these regions thus increasing surface runoff, infiltration capacity, and water flows into nearby rivers.</p></li>
<li><p>The location of vegetation and wooded areas to the west of the island is more likely to produce less susceptibility than urbanized areas.</p></li>
</ul>


<li><p>The common areas to experience more flood events are Santo Domingo and La Romana.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the very highly susceptible areas are in the eastern region for models, the spatial distribution varies.</p></li>
<li><p>The PWHadGEM85 2030 model projects higher amounts of rainfall thereby increasing the susceptibility of urban areas to flooding.</p></li>
<li><p>The influence of urbanized areas can explain the two different types of very high susceptibility regions of the southeast region. The area of ​​high susceptibility to the northwest of the island is in conjunction with more rainfall that leads to more susceptibility to flooding.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These scenarios developed by GWP are projections for 2030, 2050 and 2070.</p>

b.Climate Change. Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities</td>
<td>
<p>The country has vulnerability analysis of prioritized sectors such as food security (agriculture) and coastal marine areas. The French Development Agency (AFD) and the National Council for Climate Change and Clean Development Mechanism, under the Adapt'Action initiative, have worked on climate vulnerability studies in the food security and agriculture sectors.</p>
<p>The project "Support to the agricultural sector of the Dominican Republic in a context of climate change", financed by AFD through the Adapt'Action facility, carried out a vulnerability study of the agricultural sector in the Dominican Republic, with a particular focus on six strategic Agricultural Production Systems (SPA). The six SPAs analyzed were the following: (1) Bananas in the northwest region, Valverde, Montecristi, Dajabón and Santiago Rodríguez provinces; (2) Rice in the northwest region, provinces of Valverde, Montecristi, Dajabón and Santiago Rodríguez; (3) The bean in the southwestern region, San Juan province; (4) Cocoa in the northwest region, Duarte, Sánchez Ramírez, Samaná and Hermanas Mirabal provinces; (4) Coffee in the Septentrional mountain range between Solimán and Hermanas Mirabal in the northern region;</p>

<p>Regarding the sector of resilient cities (human settlements), the DR has the Vulnerability Index to Climate Shocks (IVACC), previously known as the Household Environmental Vulnerability Index (IVAM), designed by the Vice Presidency of the Republic, through the Unique System of Beneficiaries (SIUBEN), with technical and financial support from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).</p>
<p>The IVACC <em>is an index that calculates the probability that a household is vulnerable to the occurrence of a climatic phenomenon such as hurricanes, storms and floods, given certain socioeconomic and geographical characteristics of the household. </em>To do this, it uses data from a survey applied to households with the information provided by the Unique System of Beneficiaries (SIUBEN). This system has a coverage of 8,579,852 people, equivalent to 85.5% of the population projected by the National Statistics Office (ONE) for the country in 2015.</p>

<p>The IVACC figures for the Dominican Republic give a clear idea of ​​the type of aggregate information that it allows to reflect. The following information can be obtained at the municipality or community scale of detail. The average IVACC for the Dominican Republic is 0.524. 48.5% of households are above the national level and 30.4% of households have an IVACC greater than 0.70. In the country, the households with the greatest environmental vulnerability are those headed by people between 16 and 17 years old, with an average of 0.591. Those are followed by those households headed by older people (66 years or older) who have an average vulnerability of 0.549.</p></td>

to. Cross-cutting adaptive priorities to climate change
</td>
<td>
<p>The Dominican Republic has its National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change 2015-2030 (PNACC-RD) where it promotes the synergy between mitigation and adaptation. In this document seven transversal strategic lines (TL) were established:</p>
<p>Line T 1. Political-administrative management of the issue of climate change to facilitate the integration of adaptation and mitigation to climate change in sectoral and national policies and development plans and land use planning. Implementation or improvement of legislation to integrate climate change issues, mainstreaming adaptation, taking into account all stakeholders. Prepare Sectorial Adaptation Plans. Strengthening of risk management bodies, review and improvement of institutional and legal risk management frameworks.</p>
<p>Line T 2. Reduction of climate risk: the implementation of initiatives that reduce vulnerability to variability and climate change through sectoral risk management and increased resilience measures focused on losses and damages.</p>
<p>Line T 3. Intersectoral and inter-institutional coordination: political incidence at the national, regional and international levels for the effective approach to climate change. Creating links between institutions, engaging stakeholders in dialogue and decision-making, strengthening the community of practice on climate change, and using research for dissemination and policy formulation (research networks and observatories). Ensure that adaptation measures in one sector do not threaten the resilience of another.</p>
<p>Line T 4. Research on vulnerability, adaptation and climate change impacts and scenarios: generating information and metrics to promote knowledge of the conditioning factors, manifestations, impacts and responses of climate change. Development and updating of risk and vulnerability maps.</p>
<p>Line T 5. Strengthening of monitoring and evaluation systems, including local capacity. Strengthen the statistical system, improve the system of indicators, new and existing, including the main indicators of vulnerability as a tool to inform decision-making. Generate Early Warning Systems (EWS), which include climate change projections.</p>
<p>Line T 6. Communication, information and education to face climate change and variability. Strengthen capacities to face climate risk including disaster risk reduction, develop training programs in public and private institutions at the national and local levels.</p>
<p>Line T 7. Integration of the gender perspective: aware that the effects of climate change have a different impact on vulnerable human groups, the gender perspective is a transversal aspect of the national development model. Therefore, the role of women as agents of change is recognized and their participation is encouraged for the transformation of society towards a low-carbon and resilient development.</p>

<p>Several published documents and studies have been reviewed regarding the evaluation of investment and financial flows for sectors with priorities in adaptation. Based on these documents, a survey has been carried out to estimate the financial needs according to the investments to improve climate resilience. The Dominican Republic sees the need to mobilize financial resources for the implementation <a href="fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> of the measures identified in the NDC-RD 2020 in the following sectors:</p>
<p>In the water security sector (measures one and two), a mobilization of USD $ 670,822,568.00 is projected by the year 2030, fundamentally directed to investment projects to contribute to the improvement of access to drinking water and sanitation.</p>
<p>In the food security sector, from the sixth to the tenth measure, a mobilization of USD $ 4,736,170,000.00 is projected by 2030, fundamentally directed to all the development of irrigation projects related to agricultural areas and food security systems in controlled environments.</p>
<p>In the health sector, the three measures identified, a mobilization of USD $ 1,935,000.00 is projected by the year 2030, fundamentally directed to baseline studies, such as vulnerability studies of the health sector.</p>
<p>In the resilient cities sector, measure one is projected to mobilize USD $ 3,113,827,790.59 by 2030, mainly aimed at infrastructure works for bridges and land roads to improve communication routes between cities and communities.</p>
<p>The sectors listed below, the planned investments, indicate a strengthening of enabling frameworks and sector policies for the implementation of actions that lead to a positive result of the measures identified.</p>
<p>In the ecosystems, biodiversity and forests sector, the measures projected a mobilization of USD $ 106,686,662.14 by 2030, essentially for the timely management of protected areas, taking into account ecosystem-based adaptation, appropriate land use, avoiding degradation and deforestation, with a landscape approach that fosters ecological connectivity by implementing programs with a REDD + approach.</p>
<p>In the sector of coastal-marine resources, for the implementation of the measures, a mobilization of USD $ 7,200,630.94 is projected by the year 2030, fundamentally to promote the sustainable management of coastal-marine systems, taking into account their zoning and planning, favoring the establishment of resilient infrastructure and institutional structures that strengthen research, management and monitoring, in order to increase access to data related to climate resilience and promote early coastal ecosystem recovery.</p>
<p>In the tourism sector, the quality of tourism infrastructures depends to a large extent on the availability of financing for public and private investment. In many developing countries, access to credit is extremely expensive, and public spending on building and modernizing infrastructure is often very limited. Policies should therefore facilitate access to credit, especially for SMEs, which are the backbone of the tourism industry. This forces banks to reconsider their way of evaluating environmentally sound investments. Although such investments come at a cost, their payback periods can be relatively short and generate savings that make them economically viable and attractive.</p>
<p>The country estimates an investment of <strong>USD $ 8,715,787,192.7</strong> expressed in investments, especially in the sectors of water security, food security and resilient cities. While in the other sectors a lower investment is reflected and it is based more on strengthening the enabling frameworks for the implementation of adaptation measures in the 2021-2030 period. All this on the basis of gender equity, in a context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, which leads to an increase in climate resilience.</p>
<p>Investment by private parties specifically by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have prioritized investment in the sectors of water security, food security, and resilient cities (infrastructure, human settlements).</p>

<td>
<p>The Dominican Republic is part of several adaptation initiatives at the regional level through national institutions of various types such as ministries, non-governmental organizations (foundations, academies, among others) as well as the private sector. Within these we can mention the following:</p>
<p><strong>"Increasing Climate Resilience in the CARIFORUM Countries"</strong> is a program that seeks to support climate compatible development of the CARIFORUM countries to combat the negative impacts of climate change, while exploring the opportunities presented. The specific objectives are to improve the climate observation and monitoring networks in CARIFORUM to improve sectoral and development planning; improve the climate resilient water infrastructure of the Caribbean; develop a capacity building, education and outreach program; develop a climate risk management framework in the CARIFORUM member states. The CNCCMDL is the national coordinating body for said project.</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem-based adaptation and transformational measures to increase resilience to climate change in the Central American Dry Corridor and Arid Zones of the Dominican Republic</strong>It is a project which is going to start with the Green Climate Fund. This proposal will address these impacts at the landscape and household level in priority watersheds by promoting: i) Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EbA) through forests and agroforestry systems in prioritized watersheds; and ii) water efficient technologies in rural communities. These solutions will be supported through: i) capacity building for local governments, financial institutions and communities; ii) loans and microfinance for EBA activities and small businesses based on natural resources; and iii) integration of EbA in policies and creation of incentives. The project countries are Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic, it has a stipulated duration of seven years.</p>
<p>The <strong>Caribbean Biological Corridor (CBC)</strong>It was a project with funds from the European Union implemented by UN Environment since 2012/2015 through the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. As a result, the CBC was consolidated by defining its initial demarcation and defining and formalizing its operating and governance system. In addition, numerous investigations and pilot projects were carried out in the field. The bases of this tripartite cooperation constitute the necessary technological support for the development of capacities, the recovery of natural areas, the fight against poverty and for the increase in the quality of life. The CBC, a platform created in 2007 between the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Haiti, which Puerto Rico joined in 2016, seeks to coordinate actions for the conservation of the biodiversity of the insular Caribbean and facilitates the relationship between being human and nature in a specific geographic space. Its main objective is to reduce poverty, thus making the population more resilient against climate change.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the project with the support of the Spanish Cooperation (ARAUCLIMA), " <strong>Management of risks linked to climate change on the coasts of Latin America and the Caribbean"</strong> is executed in 17 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean that are members of the Ibero-American Network of Climate Change Offices (RIOCC). This aims to contribute to the fulfillment of the goals established by the 17 coastal countries of the Latin American region in the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to it, and the Framework Sendai for Disaster Risk Reduction.</p>
<p>The <strong>Haiti</strong> -Dominican Republic <strong>Binational Cooperation Program</strong>, supported by the European Union, has worked on the following: Local Cross-Border Development, Trade, Environment, Binational Dialogue program (composed of two subcomponents: Support to the Bilateral Mixed Commission and the Binational Observatory for Environment, Migration, Education and Commerce [OBMEC] and Visibility and Communications of the Binational Program).

d. Barriers, challenges and gaps related to adaptation planning and implementation</td>
<td>
<p>Among the general gaps / barriers found in the adaptation area for the implementation of adaptation measures, there is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Institutional barriers.</strong>There are problems of defining functions, either due to lack of legal framework or institutional framework. For example, the lack of a land use law that prevents proper planning of land use and its resources with a main focus with special focus on the issues of: solid waste management; promotion of recycling, reuse and reduction; transport; farming; drainage and transport infrastructure; among others. In addition to promoting institutional reorganization due to the mainstreaming of the climate change issue. As well as the lack of capacity of local governments to implement adaptation measures and the gap between central government planning and local governments. In the area of ​​risk management there are duplication of functions within its governance.</li>
<li><strong>Technological barriers</strong> . A technology transition is essential to achieve many of the adaptation measures. An example of this is the efficiency of irrigation systems through the redesign and change of current technology. Similarly, the technology that must be used in the supply systems. Another example is the change in technology that must be carried out in the tourism sector for the rational consumption of water. Also the lack of data that clearly shows climate risk in all productive sectors of the country, as well as their vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Financial barrier. </strong>There is no financial sustainability of the institutions and projects for the implementation of adaptation measures, which limits the continuity of these actions. In addition to the fact that financial leverage is needed to make a change in technology. Payment for water service applies extremely low rates that do not allow a return on investment to replace the infrastructure.</li>

and. Good practices and lessons learned</td>
<td>
<p>The Dominican Republic has carried out adaptation initiatives with sectors of civil society, the private sector and the government. Many of the initiatives related to adaptation are mostly at the community level and carried out by non-governmental organizations linked to the public / private sector as well as international cooperation <a href="fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> .</p>
<p>Public-private partnerships (PPP) in protected areas are successful cases that have resulted in benefits for adaptation to climate change. Some co-management agreements in protected areas can be highlighted, such as: Ébano Verde Scientific Reserve, Southeast Sanctuary, Damajagua, Quita Espuela, as well as the management of the Whale season, a sanctuary for marine mammals.</p>
<p>In all these cases, PPPs have produced positive results for the conservation of biodiversity and vital ecological and ecosystem processes, which provide environmental services of different types, regulators, goods, water and others. Similarly, the country carries out through civil society in conjunction with national authorities adaptation projects based on ecosystems in protected areas.</p>
<p>Since the Dominican Republic is a country located in the path of hurricanes, it has a history in its efforts to adapt to these events from a risk management approach. We can mention the following:</p>
<p><strong>Community Networks for Prevention, Mitigation and Response (RCPMR)</strong> . Community risk management team, made up of people from the community who have been trained in specific issues, equipped with basic tools and organized to develop prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery actions in their community. It is in charge of making contingency and emergency plans at the community level.</p>
<p><strong>Guide for the preparation of school risk management plans. </strong>Disaster prevention and risk management program. This Guide is intended to establish safe behaviors in the active student population in the national educational system, to ensure that the actors acquire skills of immediate and positive response with actions that can save their lives and those of their peers in the face of any type of event of disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Plan for Environmental and Risk Management per year. </strong>Formulated in 2009, updated in 2011 and in 2020. Support the process of social construction of a Dominican culture that incorporates Environmental and Risk Management (GAR) in its system of values, attitudes and practices from school life and promote the development of a safer, more inclusive, resilient and sustainable school infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>National Integrated Information System (SINI). </strong>It is a modern monitoring center whose purpose is to systematize knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities and risks, with a view to diagnosing the response capacity of institutions that act in the event of disasters. This tool has state-of-the-art servers with the capacity to centrally store and process geographic data produced by the institutions that are part of the SINI, through feeder nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Collection and Assessment System for the Dominican Republic (SIRED-RD</strong> ). It consists of a platform with different tools to collect, standardize, evaluate and analyze the economic losses caused by disasters. It is a system that allows the collection and control of information for the evaluation of damage caused by natural disasters. Damages are captured by an application that is installed on mobile devices.</p>

<td>f. Monitoring and Evaluation System for Adaptation to Climate Change (M&amp;E)</td>
<td>
<p>In terms of monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), the Dominican Republic has decree 541-20 that creates the National System for Measurement, Reporting and Verification of Greenhouse Gases. In its Article I Paragraph III it indicates: "All national, regional or sectoral information systems that contain information relevant to climate change, vulnerability studies and risk management can operate together and enrich the National MRV System".</p>
<p>In this sense, efforts to develop the M&amp;E System for Adaptation to Climate Change in the country are mostly concentrated in the efforts of the Initiative for Transparency of Climate Action Component Adaptation (ICAT-A) projects and the Developing Capacities project. to Advance in the Process of the National Adaptation Plan in the Dominican Republic. These initiatives will develop guidelines and tools for monitoring and reviewing priority sectors for adaptation to climate change in the country. Likewise, it seeks to strengthen human and institutional capacities, as well as the system in general, supporting the creation of a National Integrated System for Planning and Control of Climate Change and the strengthening of the National System of Environmental Information.</p>
<p>To date, the sectors with the greatest progress have been the agricultural sector focused on bananas and soon in the tourism sector.</p>
<p>These efforts will allow the evaluation of adaptation measures, determining their effectiveness and efficiency, as well as good practices in a transparent manner.</p>

<strong>1. Climate finance</strong>
</td>
<td>The implementation of the national climate commitment requires financial mechanisms and tools that allow the mobilization of resources for the identified investment. In this context, the country from 2021 will be invested in the review of its national planning, budget administration and public investment processes in the field of climate change to comply with its commitments under the NDC-RD 2020 and sustainable development, to improve the efficiency of spending in your economy.<p></p>
<p>In this way, decision-making on budget allocation and resource optimization will be strengthened to mitigate the challenges imposed by climate change on national socioeconomic growth. Additionally, it will allow the follow-up and monitoring of the proposed climate actions.</p>
<p>The country is guiding these efforts for the design of its National Climate Financing Strategy, which will have as main elements to help comply with domestic and international finances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
Generate information, data and analysis to mobilize capital flows under an institutional framework of policies and measures consistent with the country's climate objectives, economic growth priorities, fiscal responsibility and sustainable development with a long-term vision.
</li>

<li>Develop and implement macroeconomic and fiscal risk assessments; medium and long-term budget and fiscal frameworks; the identification, evaluation and selection of investment programs and projects; annual budget documents; public purchase; budget execution reports and financial statements</li>
<li>Promote the design and implementation of green financing instruments that promote the national market of economic sectors that are climate-resilient and low in carbon emissions.</li>
<li>Promote long-term public-private cooperation in understanding and managing risks and opportunities associated with climate change, for decision-making by local financial sector actors.</li>
<li>Strengthen the country's architecture before the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which allows:</li>

<li>Update the methodology for evaluating and prioritizing projects to be presented to the GCF, in light of the current and future priorities of the country. This ensuring that the prioritized projects are aligned with the National Development Strategy and with the objectives and commitments of the NDC.</li>
<li>Standardization of calls for public and private projects. The foregoing, with a view to identifying a portfolio of projects that is compatible with the goal of GHG emissions neutrality by 2050.</li>
</ul>


<p>The country proposes to achieve, based on evaluated and proposed mitigation options, mobilize an estimated investment of USD $ 8,916,950,000.00 expressed in a conditional and unconditional manner. Likewise, an investment for adaptation amounting to USD $ 8,634,707,651.67 is estimated for the sectors of water security, food security and resilient cities. While in the other sectors a lower investment is reflected and it is based more on strengthening the enabling frameworks for the implementation of adaptation measures in the 2021-2030 period.</p>
<p>These proposals consider that the country is developing and it will take a reasonable time to achieve more ambitious goals, based on equity and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and increase climate resilience.</p></td>

<strong>to. Loss and damage</strong>
</td>
<td><p>The Dominican Republic, due to its condition as a small island developing state, and because it is located in an area of ​​intense cyclonic activity, is constantly threatened by hydrometeorological events, such as tropical waves, droughts, storms and hurricanes. This represents serious challenges and threats to key socioeconomic sectors such as water, tourism, agriculture and food security, human health, biodiversity, forests, coastal marine resources, infrastructure and energy.</p>

<p>The country has worked on the realization of scenarios for hydrometeorological events that show a trend towards an increase in extreme events. The projections of the Water Center of the Humid Tropics for Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC) foresee dry seasons (December-April) intensified even more towards 2050 and 2070, with a decrease in total rainfall of up to 50% compared to the historical values ​​in the provinces of Independencia, Puerto Plata, San Juan and Santiago, as well as decreases of between 10 and 30% in provinces such as Samaná, Distrito Nacional, Altagracia, Barahona and Hato Mayor. For its part, the Global Water Partnership projections show scenarios with high susceptibility to extreme rains, floods and landslides, particularly in the northeast of the country and in Greater Santo Domingo.</p>

<p>In order to understand the impact and scope of the losses and damages generated by these events, the country has sought to strengthen its capacities to collect and evaluate losses. Together with the World Bank, the country has made estimates that show that damages associated with climatic shocks over the years have left a sequel of effects whose overcoming has required significant efforts. Between 1961 and 2014, the economic impact of disasters caused by natural phenomena is equivalent to 0.69% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>
<p>Hurricane George, in 1998, caused losses of USD $ 2,624 million (14% of GDP), being the one with the greatest damage in absolute terms. While Hurricane Jeanne, in 2004, caused damages of USD $ 417 million (1.3% of GDP). Storms Noel and Olga, which occurred in 2007, caused damages for a value of 437 million dollars, forcing to re-plan the economy and the priorities of the government, whose sum of damages and losses represented 1.2% of GDP.</p>
<p>Due to climatic shocks alone, the rains of November 2016 and April 2017 produced direct losses estimated at DOP $ 41,135.1 million <strong>(USD $ 862 million). </strong>This represented 6.6% of budgeted public spending for 2017 and 1.1% of GDP for 2017. Similarly, in September 2017, the country was impacted by hurricanes Irma and María, which caused estimated damages of PDOs. $ 8,702.4 million ( <strong>USD $ 182.4 million</strong> ). This represents 1.6% of public spending in 2017, and 0.3% of GDP in 2017.</p>
<p>Due to this reality, the country in 2019 established the <strong>Damage Collection and Evaluation System for the Dominican Republic (SIRED-RD</strong> ), housed in the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development (MEPYD), which consists of a platform with different tools to collect, standardize, evaluate and analyze economic losses caused by natural disasters. Likewise, it will contribute to reducing the negative impact of cyclones and storms in the most vulnerable areas, mainly the coastal regions (south, southwest, northeast and the urban coast of Greater Santo Domingo) and promote physical and fiscal resilience to the risk of disasters and improve sectoral planning for the transformation of a resilient country.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generation of information and data through the strengthening of <strong>the Damage Collection and Evaluation System for the Dominican Republic (SIRED-RD</strong> ). Similarly, the strengthening of disaster vulnerability analyzes is planned in conjunction with the National Integrated Information System of the National Emergency Commission.</li>


<li>Strengthen the capacities to manage slow development events, particularly in the case of drought. Currently, the Inter-institutional Technical Group on Desertification and Drought is working on the establishment of a Drought Early Warning System that allows identifying triggers to speed up communication and the activation of prevention and preparedness measures.</li>
<li>In order to strengthen the risk management governance system, the country is currently working on comprehensive legislation on climate change and risk management that includes far-reaching institutional reforms and seeks to eliminate redundancies in responsibilities of the National Prevention, Mitigation and Response System.</li>


<li>Strengthen loss and damage financing systems through the establishment of loan systems and relocation of funds in the event of emergencies, such as deferred disbursement agreements in the event of disasters with the World Bank or the institutionalization of the National Fund for Prevention, Mitigation and Response</li>

<p>From 2013 to date, no new NCDs have been carried out, so the country proposes in the NDC-RD 2020 that, as of the year 2021, it begins a process of developing an NCD for the implementation of the NDC. The priority sectors have been identified in the process of improvement and updating of the NDC, and with it the identification of the relevant technologies that must be evaluated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy generation and energy efficiency (ENT studies for technologies from renewable sources throughout the investment chain; energy efficiency based on the minimum standards of efficiency and labeling in more efficient equipment, evaluation of storage banks for electrical energy; others ).</li>
<li>Transportation (evaluation of charging stations for electric vehicles from renewable sources; evaluation of a car park from a matrix of hybrid and 100% electric vehicles; others).</li>

<strong>3. Capacity building</strong>
</td>

<td>
<p>The country intends to design an Inventory System for Climate Technologies to be transferred that includes local generation, as well as the adoption of existing technologies worldwide.</p>
  <p>The Dominican Republic, to achieve a successful implementation of its NDC, has identified needs and gaps aimed at creating and strengthening its national capacities, both human and institutional. The Third National Communication reflected that, to support the adoption of public policies that focus on the implementation of the NDC, as well as generate climate awareness, it is imperative to: a) strengthen coordination with local governments; b) promote the development and transfer of technology; c) use of renewable energy sources; and d) capacity building for international negotiations. In addition, the need to strengthen capacities to develop reliable climate scenarios was identified when conducting INGEIs in the country.</p>
<p>In parallel, the <em>Information Matters</em> project supported by GIZ focused on strengthening institutional capacities related to the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of GHGs. This project accompanied the INGEI implementation process for the Third National Communication, training participating institutions in the methodology for calculations, type of information required, serial data and use of the software for IPCC calculations to generate them. The greatest impact of this project in terms of capacity building was to sensitize institutions about the relevance of an MRV System, its scope and its instruments, such as national communications and biennial update reports (BUR).</p>
<p>The Initiative for Transparency in Climate Action (ICAT) in the DR, specifically for the MRV system, generates the creation and strengthening of national capacities to contribute to the statistical units and their processes according to the UNFCCC and the generation of data within the institutions key. Regarding M&amp;E, the country began its efforts to standardize a monitoring system to quantify adaptation measures in conjunction with mitigation measures and to strengthen the inter-institutional commitment to transparency. In particular, the National Statistics Office (ONE) needs to strengthen its human and institutional resources to control the quality of the data, based on the IPCC guidelines and methodologies for calculating GHG emissions.</p>
<p>These identified needs will ensure the quality of GHG emissions data by sector, with institutional strengthening through institutional arrangements for the establishment of processes and for the correct identification of adaptation and mitigation actions to be reflected in the biennial reports of transparency and national communications.</p>
<p>Through the Initiative Fund for the Creation of Capacities for Transparency (CBIT), the Dominican Republic will work on the gaps and barriers that limit compliance with the Paris Agreement. In particular, the CBIT project will help the country develop a strong capacity to generate good quality climate information with the necessary breadth, periodicity, relevance and precision. These improved climate data will in turn serve to enhance the periodic review of the Dominican Republic's NDC and implement and monitor it in subsequent years.</p>
<p>With the preparation of the Action Plan for the NDC RD 2015, an instrument to improve intersectoral coordination and with international cooperation partners around four central objectives for the implementation of the country's NDC in the 2019-2021 period, in its Objective IV) Develop the capacity and strengthen the cross-cutting elements of the NDC of the Dominican Republic: the need for feasibility studies (social, technical, economic), increased human capacity, tools and guides, exchange of knowledge and needs was identified training in any of the other areas / sections.</p>
<p>With the different sectoral technical consultations carried out regarding the NDC RD 2020 Improvement and Update Process, other needs for national capacities have been identified, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The country needs to strengthen national capacities to establish the implementation of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines in a homogeneous way for all sectors, according to the information from the updated AR GWPs and perform the calculations with the most updated system in the <em>IPCC Inventory Software</em> , according to latest version available.</li>
<li>Implementation of the DR NDC requires incorporating climate considerations into your national planning and budget. Technical and institutional capacity gaps and needs have been identified in areas such as greenhouse gas emissions accounting, research and systematic observation, data collection, risk modeling, and vulnerability assessments.</li>

<li>Human and institutional capacities for the development of project proposals for the different sources of climate funds.</li>
<li>Lack of human resources in key institutions, as well as rigorous guidelines and requirements, delay the implementation of concrete mitigation and adaptation actions.</li>
<li>It is important to highlight that these gaps and needs are not only identified at the macro level, but have also been identified for local governments and communities, particularly for linking municipal actions to climate action, increasing municipal resilience and mitigation capacity</li>
<li>As well as the need to increase capacities for the private sector and civil society due to their role in the implementation of the improved and updated NDC.</li>
</ul>


<p>The development of the National Framework for Enhanced Climate Transparency, which encompasses and enables all mitigation and adaptation measures implemented in the country, making their results and effectiveness transparent. In this sense, the National GHG MRV System was recently established, through Decree 541-20, structuring the process for reporting emissions, mitigation actions, and available support and financing for climate action. This National Transparency Framework is complemented by the development of the monitoring and evaluation indicators worked by ICAT-A, in its prioritized sectors.</p>
<p>Another project for the creation of capacities in the planning stage is the Project Developing Capacities to Advance in the Process of the National Adaptation Plan in the Dominican Republic, which will train the technical personnel of the pertinent government institutions in the use of these guidelines at the national and local.</p></td>

<p>The Political Constitution of the Dominican Republic (2010) incorporates important elements for the advancement of gender equality, by declaring that the State must promote equal rights between women and men (Article 39), responsible motherhood and fatherhood, and valuing domestic work (article 55), as well as sanctioning domestic and gender violence (article 42).</p>
<p>Likewise, it is ratified in Article 12 of the National Development Strategy (END 2030), which establishes the Gender Approach as a transversal policy that mandates to incorporate this approach in all plans, programs, projects and public policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the "National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resources and Skills to Advance Towards Green Development, Low Emissions and Climate Resilience" (2012) considers equity and inclusion among its basic values ​​considering gender aspects, vulnerable populations , inter and intra generational inequity, and a methodological approach without distinction of ethnic, religious or any other type.</p>
<p>The guiding principles of the National Climate Change Policy recognize integrality: <em>cultural, ethnic and gender belonging must be taken into consideration in the design of projects related to climate change.</em></p>
<p>The Third National Communication for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) includes aspects related to the promotion of gender equality (pages 149-172).</p>
<p>The National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change in the Dominican Republic 2015-2030 (PANCC-RD) constitutes an update of the previous PANA (Ministerio Ambiente, 2008) and defines two main objectives: 1) reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change , through adaptation and resilience; and 2) mainstream climate change adaptation across all policies and sectors. It has seven transversal strategic lines: political-administrative management of the climate change issue, climate risk reduction, intersectoral and inter-institutional coordination, research on vulnerability, adaptation and climate impacts and scenarios, strengthening of monitoring and evaluation systems, communication, information and education and<strong>integration of the gender perspective. </strong>This last transversal strategic line dictates <em>T 7: Integration of the Gender perspective: Aware that the effects of climate change have a different impact on vulnerable human groups, the gender perspective is a transversal aspect of the national development model.</em></p>

<p><em>Therefore, the role of women as agents of change is recognized, and their participation is encouraged for the transformation of society towards a low-carbon and resilient development.</em></p>
<p>The Gender and Climate Change Action Plan of the Dominican Republic (PAGCC-RD) arises in response to the guidelines raised in the aforementioned instruments and in response to the agreements reached at the Twentieth Conference of the Parties (COP20) of the Convention United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where the Lima Work Program on Gender was approved. This Program promotes gender equality, by including it in the decisions of climate change summits, and in national policies on climate change, in order to better face extreme climate phenomena. The PAGCC includes objectives, actions and indicators for nine prioritized sectors: energy + transport + infrastructure, agriculture and food security, waste, forestry, water,</p>
<p>Through the National Plan for Gender Equality and Equity 2020-2030 (PLANEG III) of the Ministry of Women of the Dominican Republic, gender mainstreaming is established, based on the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic, with the purpose of overcome inequalities of rights between men and women and achieve gender equality. In PLANEG III, it develops seven national themes: education for equality, integral health of women, economic autonomy, citizenship, democracy and political and social participation, gender equality and the environment (with a climate change approach), gender violence against women and digital technologies for the autonomy of women.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

The State guarantees and promotes the effective exercise of their rights, through policies and programs that permanently ensure their participation in all areas of national life and, in particular, their training and access to their first job. Similarly, Article 56, paragraph 3, provides that “adolescents are active subjects in the development process. The State, with the solidarity participation of families and society, will create opportunities to stimulate their productive transition to adult life.</p>
<p>With the National Development Strategy (END) 2010-2030, a social participation of youth is established at the highest level, taking into account the National Youth Council, highlighting the young population as part of the national development process.</p>
<p>In 2000, the General Youth Law (Law 49-00) was enacted, which defines the legal, political and institutional framework, guiding the actions of the State and society in general, towards the construction of public policies focused on meeting the needs and expectations of the nation's youth population, as well as an effective participation of youth in decision-making processes. This law creates the Secretary of State for Youth, today the Ministry of Youth, and lays the foundations for greater inclusion and development of Dominican youth.</p>
<p>Consideration of inter and intra generational is equally contemplated in the "National strategy to strengthen human resources and skills to advance towards green development, with low emissions and climate resilience" (2012).</p>
<p>National Youth Plan 2020-2030. A public policy instrument for strategic planning that seeks to be a technical resource that responds to the needs of youth from a participatory perspective, built with and from young people. It aims to deepen public youth policies with a long-term vision and give continuity to the efforts that have been achieved to date. This plan is structured around six axes: education, employment and entrepreneurship, comprehensive health, healthy environment (with a focus on mitigating and adapting to climate change), justice and citizen security, and social and political participation and inclusion.</p>
<p>From the Dominican government and from different civil society organizations, continuous efforts are increasingly being made in which youth are the key actors for their development, these efforts include different initiatives of Action for Climate Empowerment, participation in national and international events , providing different kinds of support.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure the participation of youth at the national and international level in decision-making spaces on climate change.</li>
<li>Develop, create and implement a National Network of Youth and Climate Change, which allows integrating the perspective of youth within the instruments of national climate policies.</li>

In addition to the objectives pursued and its lines of action, the END proposes seven transversal policies that must be incorporated into all plans, programs and projects. The fourth proposed policy is<em>Incorporate the dimension of territorial cohesion and ensure the necessary coordination and articulation between public policies, in order to promote a more balanced territorial development through the provision of infrastructure, services and capacities necessary to promote the development of less prosperous regions and municipalities and the promotion of regional development and competitiveness strategies that take advantage of regional diversity, with the National Development Strategy Law 2030.</em></p>
<p>The Third Strategic Axis of the END stands out, which postulates: <em>A territorially and sectorally integrated, innovative, diversified, plural, quality-oriented and environmentally sustainable economy that creates and deconcentrates wealth, generates high and sustained growth with equity and decent employment, and that takes advantage of and enhances the opportunities of the local market and is competitively inserted in the global economy.</em></p>
<p>The National Climate Change Policy recognizes the need for coordination between the risk management system and the climate change system. In this sense, within the framework of the National Multiannual Plan of the Public Sector, it was recommended that the actions required to improve the articulation between risk management and climate change adaptation policies should be developed; in the same way, the corresponding actions to strengthen the role of the municipalities within the climate change governance schemes.</p>
<p>With the publication of the "Methodological Guide for the Formulation of the Municipal Plan of Territorial Organization" a support point is provided for the creation of capacities to improve planning and the quality of development management in the territory. This guide is the result of a process of national consultations with various institutional and civil society actors, including representatives of local governments, central government and international cooperation, under the coordination of the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development. It is based on a comprehensive vision of the territory. The Guide includes mechanisms for mainstreaming the approach to adaptation to climate change, gender equity, risk management and poverty reduction in territorial planning processes.</p>
<p>Through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International City Management Association (ICMA), the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation ( AECID), with the support of the Dominican Federation of Municipalities (FEDOMU), the Planning Program for Climate Adaptation was developed, through which basic adaptation strategies were systematized that integrate, at the municipal-regional scale, the approaches present in Dominican adaptation placing emphasis on the non-occupation of vulnerable areas, the application of solutions based on nature and adaptation based on ecosystems. The municipalities studied were the National District, Santiago de los Caballeros, San Pedro de Macorís and Las Terrenas, Neiba and Polo.</p>
<p>Other examples of climate action developed from the municipalities are the declaration of Jarabacoa, La Vega, to become a resilient and carbon neutral municipality; The project is based on the attributes that this demarcation possesses, through its planning and the will of the authorities, academic entities and civil society. Other notable projects are the zero waste projects of the municipal district of Las Placetas, San José de las Matas and the Mao Zero Waste project; Waste was separated from homes, they were taken to the plant to make compost through a pilot and an awareness campaign was carried out.</p>
<p>Within the efforts framed in the support of the Climate Action Improvement Package (CAEP), there are multiple examples of climate action measures and options and their cross-cutting elements promoted and carried out by municipal governments, such as:</p>
<p>The Dominican Association of Councilors Agreement (ASODORE) and the ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability initiative, which seeks to create mechanisms to make municipalities more sustainable and climate resilient. Among the participating pilot municipalities are: Santo Domingo Este, Nigua, Sabana Grande de Boyá, Jimaní, Monte Plata, Puerto Plata, Salcedo, Consuelo and Higüey.</p></td>

<td colspan="2">
<p>Climate action and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be seen as two parallel processes. However, both need the alignment of national planning processes so that policies, measures and actions can be related to implement the NDC and the fulfillment of the National Agenda for Sustainable Development to 2030 embodied in the Sustainable Development Goals. In this way, we will be able to maximize resource efforts, as well as clearly identify the comprehensiveness and potential for impact in the prioritized sectors. Achieving the goals of the NDC, as well as the SDGs require a transformation at all levels of the country and these must be reflected and monitored in its national development strategy in the short, medium and long term.</p>
<p>The Action Plan for the NDC of the Dominican Republic for the period 2019-2021 based on the NDC-2015, through the unpublished methodology designed by the Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF) (whose original purpose is the evaluation of the contribution of the development projects financed by the entity to the NDCs and the SDG Strategies of the member countries), identified that through its 27 results and deliverables it contributes to advance in the achievement of 15 of the 17 SDGs. Likewise, the 27 strategic results of the Plan contribute at least to the achievement of 1 SDG. Some results are more transversal, in the sense of involving the 4 and 5 SDGs through their execution. From a ratings perspective, the SDGs to which the Action Plan contributes the most are, in descending order: SDG 13 (Climate Action); SDG 17 (Partnerships to achieve the goals); SDG 8 (Economic and decent work); SDG 7 (Sustainable and non-polluting energy) and SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production).</p>
<p>In the process of improving and updating the NDC-RD 2020, the link between the SDGs and the indicated goals continues to have a strong correlation. In the update of the Action Plan from the NDC-RD 2020, the connection between both agendas will be reflected for greater transparency. Initially, the following links were found by analyzing the SDG indicators with the NDC-RD 2020 targets in their relevant areas:</p>
