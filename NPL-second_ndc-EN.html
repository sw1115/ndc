<h1><strong>Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)</strong></h1>
<p> Government of Nepal</p>
<p> Kathmandu</p>
<p> December 08, 2020 </p>
<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
<p>Nepal is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. It is at high-risk due to the country’s fragile topography, the climate-sensitive livelihoods of the people and their limited adaptive capacity. Nepal is committed to acting on climate change in line with the Paris Agreement, despite the country’s negligible emissions. It is because efforts to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5°C would result in significantly lower risks for Nepal when compared to 2°C or higher. These risks are in addition to the existing impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change in the country. Nepal, therefore, calls on all Parties to increase ambition and move collectively onto emission reduction pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C warming limit.</p>
<p>The Government of Nepal hereby presents its enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement for the period 2021-2030, following Articles 4.2 and 4.11 of the Paris Agreement, and Decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 23 and 24, and other relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement. The NDC takes into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of national circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="nepals-long-term-low-greenhouse-gas-emission-development-strategy">2. Nepal's Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy </h2>
<p>Nepal envisions achieving socio-economic prosperity by building a climate-resilient society. To this end, the country has developed its policy and institutional framework. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19 of the Paris Agreement, Nepal is formulating a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy by 2021. The strategy aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050.</p>

<td><strong>Energy</strong></td>
<td><p>(Energy generation)</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2030, expand clean energy generation from approximately 1,400 MW to 15,000 MW, of which 5-10 % will be generated from mini and micro-hydro power, solar, wind and bio-energy. Of this, 5,000 MW is an unconditional target. The remainder is dependent upon the provision of funding by the international community.</li>
<li>By 2030, ensure 15% of the total energy demand is supplied from clean energy sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Transport)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales of electric vehicles (e-vehicles) in 2025 will be 25% of all private passenger vehicles sales, including two-wheelers and 20% of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales (this public passenger target does not take into account electricrickshaws and electric-tempos) in 2025. Due to this e-vehicle sales target, fossil fuel energy demand for the transportation sector will decrease from approximately 40 million GJ in the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario in 2025 to 36 million GJ. This would be around a 9% decrease in fossil fuel dependency. This target will reduce emissions from a projected BAU of 2,988 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. in 2025 to 2,734 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq., which is around 8% decrease in emissions.</li>
<li>By 2030, increase sales of e-vehicles to cover 90% of all private passenger vehicle sales, including two-wheelers and 60% of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales (the public passenger target does not take into account electric-rickshaws and electric-tempos). As a consequence, energy demand for fossil fuels will decrease from approximately 48 million GJ in the 2030 BAU scenario to 34.5 million GJ, which is around 28% decrease in fossil fuel dependency. This target will reduce emissions from a projected BAU of 3,640 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. in 2030 to 2,619 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq., which is around 28% decrease in emissions.</li>
<li>By 2030, develop 200 km of the electric rail network to support public commuting and mass transportation of goods.</li></ul>


<p>(Residential cooking and biogas)</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2030, ensure 25% of households use electric stoves as their primary mode of cooking.</li>
<li>By 2025, install 500,000 improved cookstoves, specifically in rural areas.</li>
<li>By 2025, install an additional 200,000 household biogas plants and 500 large scale biogas plants (institutional/industrial/ municipal/community).</li>
</ul>

<p>These three combined targets can reduce emissions from approximately 1,999 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. in BAU in 2025 to approximately 1,774 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. This is around 11% reduction in emissions from the cooking sector. For 2030, these three targets can reduce emissions from approximately 2,064 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. from BAU to 1,599 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq., which is around 23% reduction in emissions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>By 2025, 380 million litres/day of wastewater will be treated before being discharged, and 60,000 cubic meters/year of faecal sludge will be managed. These two activities will reduce around 258 Gg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. compared to BAU.</li>

These assessments were later verified through in-person and virtual consultations both at national and provincial levels with line ministries, experts, Local Peoples, women, Indigenous Peoples and youth.</p>
<p>The reviewed targets served as inputs for the technical work, such as the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) modelling for building scenarios and projections. The output of the technical work and inputs from consultations were further reviewed and verified by the NDC Working Committee, established by the Ministry of Forests and Environment and comprising representatives from government agencies and relevant experts. Furthermore, the NDC was discussed at the Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee on Climate Change (IMCCCC) and shared with respective line ministries and civil society organizations for formal input.

<td><p>Nepal is a landlocked country that lies in the southern face of the Himalayan mountain range. The country is located between 26<sup>0</sup> 22' and 30<sup>0</sup> 27' North latitude and 80<sup>0</sup> 04' and 88<sup>0</sup> 12' East longitude and covers an area of 147,181 square kilometres. Physiographic regions within the country include High Himal, High Mountain, Middle Mountain, Siwalik, and the <em>Tarai</em>. Within these regions, elevations range from 59 meters to 8,848 meters.</p>
<p>Nepal’s climate is influenced by the Himalayan mountain range and the South Asian Monsoon. The climate has four distinct seasons: pre-monsoon (March-May), monsoon (June-September), post-monsoon (OctoberNovember) and winter (December-February).</p>

<p>Nepal is a Least Developed Country (LDC) whose economy mostly depends on agriculture and remittances. Nepal’s per capita GDP was USD 1,085 in the fiscal year 2019/2020 with a growth rate of 7.5% from the last fiscal year. However, the impact of COVID19 is already bringing these numbers down.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, the proportion of Nepali people living in absolute material poverty has more than halved from 49% in 1992 to 23% in 2015. Rates of child and maternal mortality reduced significantly as well. Primary school enrolment now exceeds 96% and has gender parity. Average life expectancy at birth has crossed 70 years. Nepal’s pace of development has been one of the highest in the world. The latest Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) shows that 28.6% of the population is still low. This means their lives are impacted by several deprivations simultaneously. However, It also reveals that Nepal halved its official MPI between 2006 and 2014.</p>
<p>Building on the relative success of the Millennium Development Goals, Nepal is committed to pursuing and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, including the target set by the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction. These global ambitions are broadly aligned with the social, economic, environmental and risk reduction aspirations that Nepal has set for itself in its new constitution.</p>

<h2 id="adaptation-component-of-ndc">Adaptation Component of NDC </h2>
<p>As per Article 7.10 and 7.11 of the Paris Agreement, Nepal will submit an adaptation communication, which will include its priorities, implementation and support needs, plans and actions through the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The NAP will outline Nepal's contribution towards meeting the adaptation goals set out in the Paris Agreement and the required means of implementation to implement that contribution fully.</p>
<p>Nepal is at high-risk to the effects of climate change. Thus, adaptation will be a constant requirement for the country. Adaptation priorities and actions, as per the National Climate Change Policy (2019), adopt an integrated approach to cover climate-sensitive sectors exemplifying the inter-sectoral nature of the responses. The adaptation priorities cover eight thematic and four cross-cutting areas.</p>
<p>The thematic areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture and Food Security;</li>
<li>Forests, Biodiversity and Watershed Conservation;</li>
<li>Water Resources and Energy;</li>
<li>Rural and Urban Settlements;</li>
<li>Industry, Transport and Physical Infrastructure;</li>
<li>Tourism, Natural and Cultural Heritage;</li>
<li>Health, Drinking Water and Sanitation;</li>
<li>Disaster Risk Reduction and Management.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cross-cutting areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI), Livelihoods and Governance;</li>
<li>Awareness Raising and Capacity Building;</li>
<li>Research, Technology Development and Extension; </li>
 <li>Climate Finance Management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nepal will accelerate adaptation by implementing the National Environment Policy (2019), National Climate Change Policy (2019), Environment Protection Act (2019), Environment Protection Regulation (2020), National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) (2010), Framework on Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPA) (2019), Disaster Risk Reduction National Strategic Plan of Action 2018 – 2030, Fifteenth Plan (2019/2020-2023/2024), and other national strategies and action plans. The key policy priorities of Nepal, on adaptation, include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>By 2030, all 753 local governments will prepare and implement climate-resilient and gender-responsive adaptation plans. The plans will address climate change and disaster vulnerability and risks and prioritize adaptation and disaster risk reduction and management measures focusing on women, differently-abled, children, senior citizens, youth, Indigenous Peoples, economically deprived communities and people residing in climate-vulnerable geographical areas.</li>
<li>The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) will be updated every ten years. Likewise, a National level Vulnerability and Risk Assessment (VRA) will be carried out every five years to inform climate resource allocation policies.</li>
<li>By 2025, institutional mechanisms will be established and/or operationalized including Environment Protection and Climate Change Management National Council, Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Coordination Committee (IMCCCC), thematic and cross-cutting working groups (TWGs/CWGs), Climate Change Research Centre, Provincial Climate Change Coordination Committee and local level institutional structures.</li>
<li>By 2021, GESI and Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, and Climate Resilient Planning and Budgeting Guidelines will be formulated.</li>
<li>By 2025, a strategy and action plan on gender-responsive climate-smart technologies and practices will be prepared and implemented.</li>
<li>By 2025, climate change-related education will be included in all secondary schools and 2,000 climate change adaptation resource persons will be mobilized locally.</li>
<li>By 2025, climate-sensitive diseases surveillance systems will be strengthened through the integration of climate and weather information into existing surveillance systems.</li>
<li>By 2030, the population with access to the basic water supply will increase from 88% to 99%; and population with improved water supply will increase from 20% to 40%.</li>
<li>By 2025, climate risk assessment mechanisms will be integrated into WASH program planning and implementation cycle.</li>
<li>Public Weather Services (PWS), including the Agro-Meteorological Information System, will be strengthened and established.</li>
<li>By 2030, a multi-hazard monitoring and early warning system covering all the provinces will be established.</li>
<li>By 2025, a national strategy and action plan on Loss and Damage (L&amp;D) associated with climate change impacts will be devised.</li>
<li>By 2022, a Climate Finance Strategy, and National Capacity on Climate Finance Management will be formulated.</li>
<li>Adaptation measures based on circular economy and sustainable resource use will be developed and implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nepal is in the process of developing its National Adaptation Plan (NAP). Through this process, Nepal intends to implement medium and long-term adaptation needs, including urgent and immediate priorities. Key outputs of NAP include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The NAP will be formulated by 2021. It will incorporate adaptation and resilience milestones to be achieved in the short-term (by 2025), medium-term (by 2030) and long-term (by 2050).</li>
<li>By 2025, a Climate Information System will be established and operationalized.</li>
<li>By 2022, a NAP Monitoring, Reviewing and Reporting Framework will be developed and operationalized.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="means-of-implementation">Means of Implementation </h1>
<p>The cost of achieving Nepal's NDC conditional mitigation targets is estimated to be USD 25 billion. The cost of achieving unconditional targets outlined in the NDC is estimated to be USD 3.4 billion. This estimate only covers activity-based targets and does not include the cost of policies, measures and actions. The cost of achieving the adaptation component will be detailed in the upcoming National Adaptation Plan (NAP).</p>
<p>To achieve the conditional targets, Nepal anticipates financial, technological and capacity-building support from global funds such as the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund and bilateral/multilateral agencies and development partners. These funds will be utilized to bolster limited national resources and technical capacities for scaling up climate action.</p>
<p>The activities will be implemented for 10 years (2021-2030) by integrating them under the fiscal budget as various subsidy policies, projects or programs. As these targets are well aligned with the country’s existing policies and plans, they will have high ownership and will be implemented on time at the national and sub-national levels. The key elements during implementation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance:</strong> Enact key acts and regulations and strengthen institutional capacity to facilitate NDC implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Finance:</strong> Develop NDC financing and investment framework along with a strategy to streamline access to funds while bridging the gaps in the public and private sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness:</strong> Ensure maximization of economic benefits and cost-effectiveness during the implementation of the NDC.</li>
<li><strong>Equity and Inclusiveness:</strong> Include the principles of equity, ensuring equal access to women, children, youth, Indigenous Peoples and marginalized groups during participation, decision-making and benefit-sharing from NDC implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV):</strong> Promote data-driven tracking of NDC targets along with a strengthening of data generation and validation framework. Identify best practices while also incorporating lessons learnt. Maintain transparency by widely disseminating the methodology and results of the MRV.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nepal will prepare a detailed NDC implementation framework/roadmap/plan to ensure the targets will be achieved in a systematic matter. The key elements of this framework/roadmap/plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Identify and meet capacity-building needs across government bodies to enable implementation of relevant policies and improve collaboration across key ministries.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Management:</strong> Establish processes to retain knowledge within institutions, including through data management systems for transparency and MRV purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional mechanism:</strong> Implement the NDC through federal, provincial and local governments, in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders including youth, women and Indigenous People. Coordinate NDC implementation through the Environment Protection and Climate Change Management National Council, Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Coordination Committee (IMCCCC), Thematic and Cross-Cutting Working Groups, and Provincial Climate Change Coordination Committees.</li>


<li><strong>Communication and Coordination:</strong> Develop clear lines of communication between different levels of governance (local, provincial, national and international) and across different sectors and stakeholders, including women, Indigenous Peoples and youth.</li>
<li><strong>Finance:</strong> Develop a financing and investment framework that ensures efficient access to climate funds and evidence-based allocations to areas of demand, including the green recovery agenda. Ensure that the framework differentiates between sources of finance to be used in each area, including in adaptation, mitigation, and Loss and Damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Develop tools and models to support inclusive decision-making during planning and implementation of activities.</li>
