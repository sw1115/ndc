<h1>Nationally Determined Contribution of Senegal</h1>

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL</p>
One People - One Goal - One Faith Faith</p>

APPROVED DOCUMENT - DECEMBER 2020</p>

<h2>Résumé</h2>
Senegal's Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN) is part of the forward-looking vision, "Plan Senegal Emergent (PSE)", its strategy and development plans as well as sectoral programs for the sustainable management of its resources. natural and environmental. The CDN takes over the achievements of the INDC. The CPDN of Senegal was drawn up by a team of local consultants under the supervision of the Directorate of Environment and Classified Establishments (DEEC) of the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development, in collaboration with the National Committee on Climate Change (COMNACC).</p>
A national workshop held on September 14, 2015, and chaired by the Minister of the Environment and Sustainable Development, validated the INDC, with specific commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, compared to to projected emissions, by 2035. The INDC was adopted by the Council of Ministers on September 16, 2015.</p>
In 2016, Senegal embarked on the process of updating its INDC to make it a NDC which constitutes the country's commitment under the Paris Agreement. This transition responds mainly to the imperatives of updating the data (sectoral, macroeconomic, demographic, etc.) used during the preparation of the INDC, but also to the need to take charge of essential components such as Measurement, Notification and Verification (MRV), capacity building and technology transfer needs, essential for a successful implementation of the CDN as well as the integration of emissions from the oil and gas industry including the start of production is scheduled for 2022.</p>
Also, a rigorous assessment of the environmental situation made it possible to identify:</p>

<ul>
<li>the sectors of greenhouse gas emissions: transport, waste, energy, industry, forestry and agriculture;</li>
<li>sensitive areas giving priority to adaptation activities and control of the impacts of climate change: coastal erosion, agriculture, fishing, livestock, health, biodiversity and floods.</li>
</ul>

In the two components of this CDN, two objectives are set:</p>

<ul>
<li>an unconditional objective, consisting of carrying out activities with national means (State, local authorities, private sector, NGOs, etc.), and</li>
<li>a conditional objective that will be achieved with the support of the international community.</li>
</ul>

These objectives have been determined and set for each sector and an aggregation of these objectives makes it possible to assess the impact on the country's overall emissions. This translates into a relative reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 5% and 7% respectively, by 2025 and 2030, compared to the baseline (Business as usual) for the unconditional objective (CDN). This reduction could be increased to 23% and 29% respectively, by 2025 and 2030, compared to the baseline situation, if Senegal benefits from the support of the international community with substantial funding, the facilitation of the transfer of environmentally sound technologies. and strengthening its institutional and human capacities in the area of ​​climate change (CDN +).</p>
In 2010, global emissions stood at 16,752 Gg of C0 2</sub> equivalent. They will experience steady growth, reaching 37,761 Gg in 2030.</p>

Several studies carried out in Senegal provide information on the consequences of climate change. The impacts observed show a downward trend in rainfall, an increase in average temperatures, a rise in sea level, disturbances in the availability of cultivable areas, hydraulic and fishery resources. They reflect the great vulnerability of Senegal's ecosystems, requiring recourse to specific mitigation and adaptation actions in the face of future climate prospects, in order to control their potential impacts, particularly in socio-economic terms on the 60% of the population whose livelihood depends directly on these resources.</p>
On the projected climate risks, their potential impacts as well as the vulnerabilities induced, the models globally show a predominance of the risks of droughts, heat waves and an increase in extreme wet events. The occurrence of these risks exposes the regions of Senegal differently.</p>
The regions most affected by the increased risk of extreme drought are located in the north of Senegal, the region of Saint Louis showing the most intense risk, for an increase in the frequency of droughts of between 20 and 30%.</p>
The frequency of extreme wet events is higher in the low warming scenario, mainly for the areas located to the north and east of Senegal (Matam, Tambacounda, Louga).</p>
The implementation of the Senegal Contribution is estimated at a cost of US $ 13 billion, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
8.7 billion dedicated to <em><strong><span class="underline">mitigation</span></strong></em> with 3.4 billion US dollars, unconditional, and 5.3 billion US conditional; and
</li>
<li>
4.3 billion US for <em><strong><span class="underline">adaptation</span></strong></em> , including 1.4 billion US unconditional and 2.9 billion US conditional.
</li>
</ul>
The unconditional and conditional totals are respectively US $ 4.8 billion and US $ 8.2 billion.</p>
It will require significant financial, human and technological resources on the part of Senegal, but also the support of the international community, in order to allow even more significant reductions in GHG emissions and resilience to climate change.</p>
Simulations made it possible to assess the impacts and expected socio-economic benefits of these measures. Although intervening directly in the sectors mentioned above, these measures constitute a lever for improving the national economic situation, public health, the management of problems linked to urbanization, etc.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>
The Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) is the reference framework for Senegal's economic and social policy by 2035. The PSE focuses on economic growth based mainly on the intensification of activity in the primary and secondary sectors. . However, the current losses and damages as well as the projected impacts of climate change on arable land, hydraulic and fishery resources are likely to compromise the success of the PES.</p>
In view of the country's high exposure and vulnerability to climate change and in response to the Paris Agreement, Senegal intends to contribute to the collective effort, through the implementation of mitigation measures and 'adaptation in priority economic sectors, communities, infrastructure, ecosystems and cities.</p>
The strategy is based on the integration of the climate change dimension in the formulation and programming of development policies, taking into account other priorities such as human and animal health, the fight against poverty and malnutrition, the promotion of renewable energies. and energy efficiency and gender mainstreaming.</p>
Regarding the latter, Senegal has embarked on the implementation of a National Strategy for Gender Equity and Equality (SNEEG), based on the promotion of gender equity and equality which calls out to all development actors. The Government has made a commitment to integrate the issue of gender into all public policies.</p>
The Senegal CDN is part of the PSE, echoing its Priority Action Plans. </p>


<h2 id="i.-contexte">I. Contexte </h2>

<p>a. <span class="underline">Evolution des Emissions</span></p>

Senegal submitted three communications to the UNFCCC in 1997, 2010 and 2015, with respectively, as base years: 1994, 2000 and 2005. This shows a net increase in national emissions. The energy and agriculture sectors are the major sources accounting for 40% and 48% of emissions, respectively, in 2005. The dynamics show an increase in emissions in all sectors between 1994 and 2005, except for the waste sector which has required data refinement in 2005 (Table 2).</p>
The detailed information concerning the 03 communications submitted is summarized in the following table:</p>

Senegal has gradually improved the method of inventorying GHGs in the forestry sector, with the use of certain specific factors, the collection of more precise data on forestry formations and the application of recent IPCC guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>b. Main climate trends and associated risks</strong></p>
Climate trends in Senegal were assessed on the basis of three key parameters, including temperature, rainfall and sea state. These trends were modeled using the two scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.</p>
Information on climate scenarios and trends is presented in the following tables:</p>

<p><strong>vs. Impacts And Vulnerabilities</strong></p><p>
</p>The assessment of the various impacts and vulnerabilities at the national level shows that all the key sectors of the PES all remain directly or indirectly exposed to the impacts of climate change. This vulnerability affects communities, ecosystems, infrastructure and the national economy. Economically, a simulation using the T21 model shows that the increase in temperatures will have a negative impact on GDP growth and lead to a higher level of poverty in Senegal (Figures 1 and 2) <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> .</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: Effects of temperature increase on poverty reduction Source: Planning Department (MEFP)</strong></p>

Maintaining the trends observed in the past, in particular the rise in temperatures and the fall in rainfall, will have negative effects on the productive bases of the national economy (biodiversity, agriculture, livestock, water resources, fishing, coastal zone, etc.) by 2031-2041. Climate change thus appears to be a brake on development and the fight against poverty. This represents a major challenge for achieving the PES objectives by 2035.</p>
<p><strong>d. Equity and Ambition</strong></p><p>

</p>Senegal's CDN reflects a sustained commitment to place the country on a low-carbon development path ensuring the resilience of the economy, communities, infrastructure and cities.</p>
The NDC is equitable with regard to the national capacities and the climate vulnerability of the country. It is ambitious in that it goes beyond the proposed strategies and programs granted to LDCs and SIDS in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-composante-atténuation">II. Mitigation component</h2>
The contribution foresees a reduction in GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 in different sectors of the economy compared to the emissions projected for the same years, according to a reference scenario based on a number of assumptions. It consists of an unconditional contribution (CDN) and a conditional contribution (CDN +).</p>
The main activities provided for in the unconditional and conditional contributions cover each sector of the Senegalese economy and their impacts are presented in relation to the GHG emissions of each sector. An aggregation of these emission reductions is also presented to see their evolution in relation to overall emissions. Senegal undertakes, unconditionally and conditionally to reduce its GHG emissions, respectively in 2025 and 2030, compared to the emissions projected for the same years, according to a “Business as Usual” scenario in the following sectors:</p>

Two sectors stand out as the main emitters of GHGs at the national level. The energy sector will experience exponential growth. In fact, it will represent more than 50% of the country's global emissions in 2022. This situation can be explained by the dynamism of the sector with in particular the start of oil and gas exploitation from 2022.</p>
Emissions from the agriculture sector will increase gradually and steadily until 2030. Enteric fermentation will remain the major category of emissions in this sector.</p>

<h3>vs. Treatment of emission reductions involving mechanisms linked and not linked to carbon markets</h3>

Market mechanisms are a prime tool for implementing NDCs. As with the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol, Senegal will continue to carry out mitigation activities within the framework of the international carbon market mechanisms of the Paris Agreement for the purposes of the NDC with the collaboration of international partners.</p>
Senegal undertakes to respect the rules that guarantee environmental integrity, promote sustainable development and avoid double counting of emission reductions, in accordance with the rules that will be adopted within the framework of Article 6 of the Agreement of Paris. Senegal also supports a coherent transition of its CDM project portfolio, in the context of the Paris Agreement, taking into account the rules that will be adopted under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
Senegal's NDC contains a wide range of mitigation activities in the energy, forestry, agriculture, industry and waste sectors. Achievement of conditional targets could be met through market mechanisms. An appropriate emission reduction sharing arrangement between Senegal and partner countries should be considered.</p>
Carbon market projects should help finance adaptation.</p>
<h3 id="d.-traitement-des-émissions-issues-des-substances-appauvrissant-la-couche-dozone-sao">d. Treatment of emissions from ozone-depleting substances (ODS)</h3>
Some ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are also GHGs, with, more or less, very significant global warming powers</p>
The regulation of these substances is provided by the Vienna Convention, the Montreal Protocol as well as the Kigali Amendment. At the national level, progress in the implementation of these legal texts has been noted with the establishment of:</p>

o Decree No. 2000.73 of January 31, 2000 relating to the consumption of ODS (CFCs, HCFCs); o an interministerial decree n ° 00526 of January 15, 2014 relating to HCFCs, currently in application; o an interministerial decree to integrate the reduction of HFCs which have a very high warming potential.</p>

Results have been obtained in the implementation of actions aimed at reducing or even eliminating the consumption of ODS, these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Phase-out of CFCs for consumption since 2010;
</li>
<li>
The forecast reduction in HCFC consumption by 35% in 2020 and total phase-out in 2030;
</li>
<li>
The forecast for the reduction of HFC consumption by 10, 30, 50% and 80% respectively in 2029, 2035,2040 and 2045. With the help of the international community, outside the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol, this program could be accelerated under the Kigali Amendment.
</li>
</ul>
Based on this observation, Senegal expresses its interest in continuing the fight against ODS as well as the implementation of related flagship programs in connection with existing international initiatives, in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy efficiency in industry and the large tertiary sector;</li>
<li>The introduction of efficient food refrigeration equipment;</li>
</ul>
Appropriate regulations will be put in place on energy standards for household appliances.</p>
The impacts in terms of reduction of GHG emissions expected from the implementation of (1) the Kigali Amendment (substitution of HFCs) (2) of additional flagship programs on ODS are presented in the table below:</p>

<h3>d. <span class="underline">Adaptation implementation mechanism</span></h3>
The dynamic nature of vulnerability, often influenced by several factors (environmental, socio-economic, political and institutional), makes any action to adapt to climate change complex. The points below therefore constitute major issues that Senegal must master:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Adaptation planning at the national level</strong> : Adaptation initiatives undertaken and implemented at the national level usually provide responses to emergency situations. The National Adaptation Plan (PNA) currently being drawn up will make it possible to integrate a planning approach in the short, medium and long term in future initiatives in Senegal;</li>
<li><strong>Good mastery of the regulatory framework and the means of implementing commitments</strong> : the proper execution of commitments will require the strengthening of technical (regular system of quantitative and qualitative data collection), technological (appropriate equipment) and human (knowledge building) resources and updating of curricula). It will also be necessary to ensure the establishment of simplified legislative procedures and sectoral codes (fishing code, environmental code, forestry code, etc.) taking charge of climate dynamics;</li>
<li><strong>The implementation of a multisectoral approach</strong> : climate change has a transversal impact on key sectors of the national economy. Effective resilience in the face of this problem requires the adoption of a multisectoral and intersectoral approach to strengthen consultation between actors and facilitate the establishment of a harmonized framework for future interventions;</li>
<li><strong>Developing an effective communication strategy</strong> : it is essential that political actors are made aware of the effects of climate change, as are the affected communities. The adoption of a communication strategy oriented "citizen" and "decision maker" then becomes a necessity, in order to better involve all the stakeholders in the process initiated by Senegal;</li>
<li><strong>Assessing the cost of adaptation</strong> : Climate change is an ongoing process. In addition to defining how adaptation will be carried out, it is essential to know at what cost can we adapt in the face of an ever-changing climate. This assessment is often lacking due to the lack of data and modeling which allow to correctly identify the economic desirability of the adaptation measures envisaged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iv.-système-de-suivi-rapportage-et-vérification-de-la-cdn">IV. CDN monitoring, reporting and verification system</h2>

Under the supervision of the Directorate of Environment and Classified Establishments of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and with the support of COMNACC, the monitoring and evaluation of the CDN will be carried out by the sectoral technical services.</p>
This will include, among other things, monitoring the implementation of the activities provided for in this contribution as well as the various indicators of the CDN.</p>
A capacity building plan for the sectors concerned by the MRV will be established in the CDN implementation strategy with the corresponding costs.</p>

<h2 id="v.-mise-en-œuvre-financière-de-la-cdn"> V. Financial implementation of the NDC </h2>

The assessment of the financing needs of actions to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change provided for in this CDN is based on the lists of programs and projects identified (see appendix 1 and 2). It should be noted that the achievement of the CDN is accompanied by the development of an operational strategy for the execution and financing of the CDN.</p>
This strategy will make it possible to establish the appropriate technical, social and financial modalities favorable to the achievement of the NDC on time.</p>

<h3 id="atténuation">1. Mitigation </h3>

The financing needs for the Mitigation of GHG emissions amount to approximately 8.7 billion US dollars of which 3.4 billion dollars in unconditional and 5.3 billion US dollars in conditional. (See table for more details)</p>

<p><strong><span class="underline">Note</span></strong> : This estimate does not cover aspects related to capacity building. These are estimated at US $ 100 million during the period 2020-2030.</p>

<h3 id="a.-articulation-entre-la-cdn-et-le-plan-dactions-prioritaires-pap-du-pse-2">at. Articulation between the CDN and the Priority Action Plan (PAP) of the PSE 2</h3>

As part of the integration of Climate Change into public development policies, a simulation of the level of consideration of CDN options at PAP-PSE 2 level was proposed. The simulation makes a comparative analysis between the cost of the actions of the unconditional CDN under its adaptation / mitigation components and that of the low-carbon and climate-resilient projects / programs of the PAP PSE2. The analysis led to the following conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>The implementation of the “climate” projects of PAP PSE 2 will allow Senegal to respect the commitments contained in the unconditional CDN. As proof, the overall cost of the climate projects of the PAP-PSE2 is estimated at 3162 billion FCFA, while that of the unconditional CDN is 2734 billion FCFA;</p></li>
<li>This simulation on how the climate is taken into account in PSE2 shows significant progress in the process of greening our public policies. It is important to continue this dynamic noted in certain sectors (energy, flooding, industry, etc.) and to improve the inclusion of others (coastal erosion, livestock, health, etc.) in PSE2.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b.-retombées-socio--économiques-des-mesures-prévues">b. Socio-economic benefits of the planned measures</h3>

The analysis of the impact of the planned options is carried out using the T21-iSDG-Senegal model, which is an integrated medium and long-term planning tool. Through its systemic approach, it integrates multiple economic, social and environmental variables into a single coherent framework. A major strength of T21-iSDG-Senegal is that the tool reproduces the complex network of causal interdependencies and the many important feedback loops that are the engine of growth and development. To do this, two scenarios are considered: the base scenario (BAU) and the PSE scenario which perfectly integrates the options provided for in the CDN (see part 4).</p>
The implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures planned by Senegal under the PSE, in phase 2, should generate significant socioeconomic benefits in several sectors. At the macroeconomic level, these investments should stimulate economic growth, create jobs and induce poverty reduction. In terms of production, the simulations indicate an average annual growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) of 9.1% over the second phase of the PSE (2019-2023) and 7.9% by 2035. This increase of wealth is also accompanied by an improvement in the standard of living of Senegalese. In line with the options provided for in the PSE, the incidence of poverty is expected to decline by 9.4 percentage points compared to the baseline scenario in 2023 and 6.3 in 2035.</p>



<p><img src="SEN-NDC1_12.png"></p>


In the agriculture and land management sector, planned investments are expected to improve soil yield levels and increase production. Thus, agricultural production should grow at an average rate of 3.3% over the period 2019-2035. This performance would promote the availability of food and contribute to better food and nutritional security. Thus, the nutrition quality index is expected to increase by 27.5% compared to the baseline scenario in 2035.</p>

<p><img src="SEN-NDC1_13.png"></p>



<p><strong>Source: Simulations based on the T21-iSDG-Senegal model</strong></p>




In the energy and waste management sector, the options provided for in the NDC should reduce CO2 emissions through the promotion of renewable energies in the energy mix as well as the collection and treatment of waste in urban areas. The share of clean energy is expected to reach 40.7% of global electricity production in 2035, in the PSE scenario against 32.8% in the status quo. These measures will make it possible to expand access to energy for the populations and improve the well-being of households. In addition, a significant contribution to the country's energy independence is expected. Otherwise,</p>

<li>The socio-economic benefits expected from flood prevention correspond to the losses and damages avoided;</p></li>
<li>Reduction of the risk linked to the proliferation of water-borne diseases (diarrhea, dysentery), malaria and skin diseases;</p></li>
<li>Reduction of the risk of school loss due to the occupation of schools by the victims or the inability to go to classrooms during the rainy season</p></li>

<h2 id="conclusion"> Conclusion </h2>

The contribution stated by Senegal reflects the government's strong will to mitigate GHG emissions in all sectors of the economy. These reductions are greatest in the energy and agricultural sectors which today contribute the most to the CO 2</sub> emissions recorded at national level.</p>
It also sets out several specific adaptation measures, taking into account the impact of climate change on key axes of the Senegalese economy. This unprecedented effort is a condition for the success of the Senegal Emerging Plan (PSE), hence the strong involvement of Senegalese political decision-makers in defining and monitoring this contribution.</p>
Success will also depend on the willingness of all countries engaged in the fight against climate change to work in a concerted approach and pooling resources.</p>
