<h1>An interim Submission: Sudan's updated First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)</h1>
<h2>5/31/2021</h2>

<h2><p>Introduction:</p></h2>
<p>Sudan is highly committed to its climate change obligations and has prepared and submitted its First NDC to the UNFCCC Secretariat in Oct 2015. Sudan NDC was in line with Art. 4 of the Paris Agreement (PA), follows the guidance for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) under Art 4.6 of the Paris Agreement, which stipulates that LDCs may prepare and communicate strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emission development.</p>
<p>Sudan's NDC 2015 includes ambitious contributions, in line with Art.3 of the PA, on both climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, after the entry into force of the PA and the adoption of work programme for its implementation (Katowice, Dec 2018), Sudan established a national process for updating its NDC in response to the calls under Art.4.lI of the PA and in particular decision 4/CMA.I, para 7 of the 24th Conference of the Parties. The objectiveswere to update and resubmit an enhanced First NDC in line with Art 4.6 of the PA and relevant CMA decisions, and developing the necessary institutional infrastructure, capacities, funding strategies for the NDC implementation, integration and reporting as required under the PA. Efforts aimed at transforming the NDC from a communication document into an action plan implementable within the timeframe for First NDCs (2021-2030).</p>

<p>Given the urgent need for assessing the aggregated ambition of the collective global efforts included the updated NDCs of all Parties, Sudan is pleased to submit information on its updated contributions for consideration by the UNFCCC secretariat. Sudan's final updated First NDC will be endorsed by the Cabinet of Ministers and submitted in due course. The submission of an interim updated NDC is also meant to satisfy requirements for accessing climate finance.</p>
<h2><p>The mitigation component:</p></h2>
<p>Sudan is committed to pursue a low emission and resilient sustainable development in the energy, forestry and land use sectors. Sudan's updated NDC on mitigation as shown in the Tables below aim at contributing to increasing the ambition of the global mitigation efforts in the 2021-2030 period, in line with the objectives of the PA. These contributions are planned to ensure deviation from the current BAU trajectory in the development of the energy and forestry sectors.</p>
<p>Sudan updated mitigation contributions are considered fair and ambitious given its obligations under the UNFCC and PA. These updated contributions are in line with the national development planning processes, objectives, priorities and circumstances in the energy, forestry and land use sectors.</p>

<h2><p>Adaptation Component:</p></h2>
<p>Climate change represents significant threat to food security and sustainable development in Sudan, as more than 70% of the livelihoods are dependent on vulnerable sectors. The national studies identified water, agriculture, coastal zone, and health sectors as the most vulnerable sectors in the country. Accordingly, Sudan prioritizes actions on climate change adaptation planning and implementation with the objectives of building resilience and facilitating the integration of climate change into development plans and strategies particularly as initiated by the Sudan NAP in 2016.</p>
<p>Since the INCD (2015) Sudan implemented/implementing and identified several adaptation measures that are highly required for addressing climate change impacts in the 18 states of the country. The update of the NDC will be informed by the ongoing work including the currently underway NAP Readiness project (2021-2022), that gives emphasis to enhancement of the level of precision of climate change data/information (for assessment of CC impacts and vulnerability inthe medium and long-term), capacity building and strengthening national institutions. The third national communication that is currently been finalized, conducted assessment of current and projected climate change vulnerability/impacts on the agriculture sector (farming system and livestock). The findings of these studies underlined the importance of preparedness for facing anticipated vulnerabilities/impacts, through implementation of adaptation measures that build resilience in the vulnerable sectors.</p>

<p>The NDC will update measures for sectors that are at high risk from the current and projected impacts of climate change, namely: agriculture, water, health and the coastal zone. The aim is to promote sustainable development that improves adaptive capacity and limit growth of GHGs emissions through integration of climate change issues and concerns into national polices, strategies and development plans.</p>
