  <h1>NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 2021-2030 OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT</h1>
<p>DECISION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA</p>
<p>«22» April 2021 N 610 - L</p>
<p>ON APPROVAL OF THE NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 2021-2030 OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA TO PARIS AGREEMENT </p>
<p>Based on the Article 146 of the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia and taking into consideration paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 8 of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, the Government of the Republic of Armenia decides to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Approve the Nationally determined contribution 2021-2030 of the Republic of Armenia to the Paris Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>This decision enters into force the next day following its official publication.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Annex to the Government Decision N 610 – L, 22 April 2021</p>
<h2>NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 2021-2030 OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT</h2>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Republic of Armenia ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in May 1993. In December 2002, Armenia ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and in February 2017, it ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. In May 2019, the Republic of Armenia ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, undertaking a commitment to phase down HFCs<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Armenia remains committed to multilateral process addressing the climate change.</p></li>
<li><p>The Republic of Armenia submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in September 2015. The INDC started with a preparatory period 2015-2019, following with a next phase from 2020, with a horizon to 2050.</p></li>
<li><p>With the ratification of the Paris Agreement in February 2017, the INDC of Armenia became its nationally determined contribution (NDC) for the period of 2015 – 2050.</p></li>
<li><p>The Republic of Armenia is a developing country and, as a developing country Party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, it is not included in the Annex I to the Convention. Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement provides that developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reductions targets, and that developing country Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>In its 2015 INDC, Armenia undertook to pursue economy-wide mitigation measures, striving to achieve per capita net emissions of 2.07 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq in 2050, subject to adequate international financial, technological and capacity-building support.</p></li>


<li><p>By 2030, Armenia is going to double its share of renewables in energy generation on the path to achieve climate neutrality in the second half of this century.</p></li>
<li><p>Armenia is a land-locked country with vulnerable mountainous ecosystems, already facing negative impacts of climate change and water scarcity. Therefore, adaptation policies and measures are of paramount importance for Armenia’s ability to achieve its social and economic development goals.</p></li>
<li><p>This submission constitutes the update of the INDC, which was submitted in 2015, following guidance provided by decision 4/CMA.1, decision 9/CMA.1 and decision 18/CMA.1. It provides up-front information on the emission reductions to be achieved by 2030 and on adaptation measures to be undertaken as part of the NDC, together with information on “action and support”.</p></li>
<li><p>The NDC is based on the principle of green economy and is compatible with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflected in social and economic development goals of the Republic of Armenia.</p></li>
<li><p>In its updated NDC, the Republic of Armenia adopts a ten-year NDC implementation period (2021-2030) unlike its INDC, which proposed a timeframe of 2015-2050. Armenia maintains its 2050 mitigation goal of reducing its GHG emissions to at most 2.07 tCO<sub>2</sub>eq/capita, to be reflected in its Long Term - Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). The new mitigation target to be achieved in 2030 equals 40 per cent reduction below 1990 emissions levels.</p></li>

<p><strong>Planning processes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Coordination of the NDC preparation and monitoring of its implementation is a task of the Inter-agency Coordinating Council on Climate Change, established by the Decision No 955 of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia of 02 October 2012. The Council is composed of representatives of 10 ministries, three State agencies adjunct to the Government and two independent bodies, namely the Armenian Public Services Regulatory Commission and Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia.</li>
<li>Public consultation process of the NDC update has been carried out in line with the government procedures, including involvement of the civil society, in a gender-responsive manner, and followed by a parliamentary debate.


<li>The implementation of the NDC will be supported on subnational level by involving local communities and encouraging all stakeholders to take action, including NGOs, taking into account the needs of youth, vulnerable groups, in a gender-responsive manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In the planning processes, the following national circumstances have been considered:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Armenia GHG emissions come primarily from the energy sector (electricity and heat generation, other stationary and mobile combustion including in transport and residential sectors, fugitive emissions from natural gas system). In 2018, total primary energy supply (TPES) in Armenia amounted to 3.15 million toe or 1.1 toe/capita;</li>
<li>Armenia has practically no domestic resources of fossil fuels and highly depends on fossil fuel imports. In 2018, 28.4 per cent of TPES was covered by indigenous resources: nuclear energy, hydro energy, biofuels, and small share of solar and wind energy;</li>
<li>Natural gas accounted for 64.9 per cent of Armenia’s TPES in 2018 (2.04 million toe), followed by oil products: 10.2 per cent (0.3 million toe). Energy efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy development are key priorities for the country’s energy security and key drivers of low carbon development;</li>
<li>In 2018, Armenia produced 0.67 million toe electricity, of which 43.3 per cent came from natural gas fired thermal power plants, 29.8 per cent came from hydro power plants, 26.6 percent came from nuclear power plant and 0.3 per cent from wind and solar plants. Since 1990, Armenia gradually and completely phased out fuel oil (mazut) from the electricity mix. The government of Armenia does not subsidize the use of fossil fuels;</li>

<li>  Total final consumption of energy in 2018 was 2.15 million toe. Households are the largest consumers of final energy (33.1 per cent). Transport is the second largest final energy consuming sector (33.0 per cent);</li>


<li> Armenia is a small, landlocked country, it is responsible for 0.02 per cent of global GHG emissions. In 2017, total GHG emissions amounted to 10,624 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq and net GHG emissions amounted to 10,180 Gg CO<sub>2</sub>eq (NIR 2017);</li>



<li>Armenia is an upper-middle income country with a small population, yet Armenia is assuming its responsibility and is ready to do its fair share in terms of emission reductions. In line with the outcomes of the Talanoa Dialogue of 2017-2018, Armenia is prepared to increase its ambition and in time go climate neutral with the help of international donors;</li>



<li>Long-term planning until 2050 will be undertaken as part of preparation of Armenia’s Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy, with a view to the government adopting this document in 2021. Armenia anticipates being able to access adequate financial, technological, and capacity building support to mitigate and adapt to climate change;</li>



<li>The main considerations taken into account by the government when updating the NDC were to maintain the growth of national economy, poverty reduction, environment protection,achievement of sustainable development goals, while increasing national energy security and ensuring affordable and clean energy supply.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Implementation plans</strong></p>
<p>Implementation of the 2021-2030 NDC is safeguarded by the national and sectoral strategies and their implementation programmes, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Republic of Armenia 2014-2025 Strategic Program of Perspective Development<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> outlines actions to maximize the use of domestic energy resources, focusing on renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency;</li>
<li>Programme of the Government of Armenia<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> (2019) puts emphasis on the development of nuclear energy, renewable energy sources, introduction of energy efficient and new technologies for ensuring energy security and providing affordable and reliable energy supply as well as for mitigating and preventing problems resulting from climate change, pursuant to the commitments under international agreements, the development and implementation of a sustainable policy for promoting green economy and achieving longterm sustainable development goals;</li>
<li>Provisions of the EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement Roadmap<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> with 12 actions on climate change and 34 energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy security actions;</li>

<p><strong>Financing</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The financing needs assessment is part of the National Implementation Plan for 2021-2030 NDC, which is under preparation;</p>


<li>Armenia seeks to develop a debt-for-climate innovative financial swap mechanism, which aims at leveraging additional finance into climate action and suggests innovating not only the technical aspects of the debt-for-climate transaction, but the prioritization and value of commitments undertaken by countries across the world on a bilateral and multilateral level.</li>

<td><strong>Adaptation to climate change</strong></td>
<td>
<p><strong>In the planning processes, the following national circumstances have been considered</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Armenia is a land-locked, mountainous country with altitudes ranging from 375 to 4090 meters above sea level and has six climate zones: dry subtropical, semi dessert, steppe, forest, alpine and cold high mountainous;</li>
<li>The climate of Armenia is rather dry with annual precipitations of 592 mm, some regions are arid, while the highest levels of precipitation are observed in the mountains. Within the period of 1935-2016 the total precipitation decreased by about 9 per cent (with faster decrease after 1996) which necessitates corresponding adaptation measures in agriculture and better water management;</li>
<li>The average air temperature has significantly increased compared to the 1961-1990 annual average: by 1.03°C during 1929-2012, and during 1929-2016 this increase made 1.23°C.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basis and approaches to adaptation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptation strategy and contributions are based on the requirement of the UNFCCC Article 2 “Objective”, which is to restrain climate change within timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. Thus, the natural ecosystems adaptation approach in NDC is considered pivotal for Armenia’s adaptation strategy and actions (contribution), and a basis for the development of the National Adaptation Plan 2021-2030.</li>
<li>General objective of the NAP process is to promote reduction and management of climate risks in Armenia by addressing the impacts of climate change, taking advantage of emerging opportunities, avoiding losses and damages and building mechanisms enabling adaptation of natural, human, production and infrastructure systems. Adaptation activities will be prioritized based on sectors’ vulnerability to climate change:</li>
<ul><li>

Natural ecosystems (aquatic and terrestrial, including forest ecosystems, biodiversity and land cover)</li>
<li>Human health</li>
<li>Water resource management</li>
<li>Agriculture, including fishery and forests</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Human settlements and infrastructures</li>
<li>Tourism.</li></ul>


<li>The Republic of Armenia embraces the ecosystem approach for adapting to climate change. The ecosystem-based approach to adaptation is in harmony with the environmental policy of the country, linked to the Long-Term Strategy to 2050 and to Armenia development priorities.</li>
<li>Ecosystem based Adaptation is expected to become part of policy mix in each sector, as reflected in Sectoral Adaptation Plans (SAPs). This ensures that mechanisms and policies supporting improved biodiversity and ecosystem services, income generation, poverty reduction, adoptive development or resilience of infrastructure and carbon emission mitigation co-benefits are integrated into sectoral and sub-national activities to reduce the country’s overall vulnerability to climate change.
<li>The NAP will undergo periodic review and revision in 5-year cycles, in conjunction with updates to the National Communications, submission of adaptation communications and other relevant Measuring Reporting and Verification processes under the Convention and the Paris Agreement, providing the information necessary to track progress on the implementation and achievement of policies and measures.</li></ul>

<li>The IPCC 2006 Inventory Software, developed for these Guidelines, was used for data entry, emission calculation, results analysis and conclusions.</li>
<li>Global Warming Potential was used on a 100year timescale in accordance with the IPCC’s 2nd Assessment Report (“1995 IPCC GWP Values”) as a basis for conversion of CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, F-gases emissions to CO<sub>2</sub>eq.


<li>GHG emissions and removals were estimated using tier 1, 2 and 3 methodologies from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. In the case of key categories, tier 2 and 3 methodologies were mainly applied. Tier 3 methods were used for estimating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from electricity generation and cement production. Tier 2 methods were used for estimating emissions from stationary and mobile combustion of natural gas, fugitive CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from natural gas, HFC emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning (method 2A), CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management of cattle, buffalo and sheep, net CO<sub>2</sub> removals from forest land remaining forest land, and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from solid waste disposal.</li>
