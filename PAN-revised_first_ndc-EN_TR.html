<h1>Nationally Determined Contribution of Panama (CDN1). </h1>
<p> First update.</p>
<p>December 2020</p>

<h2 id="prólogo">FOREWORD</h2>

<p>The Panamanian nation has a vocation of service and connectivity that has marked the history of the country since its inception. With a strategic geographical position, an exuberant natural heritage and robust economic growth results, the country has the necessary elements to guarantee a decent life to its inhabitants, but this will not be possible if the challenge of climate change is not assumed with the most high priority and perspective of the State as a key condition of the environment that puts at risk the natural and material heritage that sustains us.</p>
<p>In compliance with the commitments acquired before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Republic of Panama presents in December 2020, the update of the First Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN1) presented in 2016. This present Update represents the evolution of a climate action perspective from environmental management, towards a management aimed at decarbonizing the economy and increasing climate resilience at the national, local and sectoral levels. This paradigm shift is the goal to which we are committed.</p>
<p>The transformational aspiration of the economy is the main characteristic of the process of updating the climate commitments that we have undertaken as a country, and which, far from representing a point of arrival, is another milestone on the road to sustainable development, low in emissions, resilient and inclusive. Hence the slogan "Panama Transform yourself" as a call for joint and strategic climate action.</p>
<p>The Updated CDN1 undertakes climate action from an integrated approach, which seeks to overcome the adaptation-mitigation dichotomy, proposing commitments that integrate both dimensions. The Updated CDN1 includes the development and implementation of climate planning and management instruments that mark the path towards resilience, covering ten sectors and strategic areas of the Panamanian economy, marking a transition from existing national policy instruments to the implementation and use of operational climate instruments at the sectoral and transversal level, covering the entire economy.</p>
<p>In this sense, together with the commitment to reduce emissions in the energy sector, framed in the context of the Energy Transition Agenda, Panama presents for the first time commitments that include the development and implementation of climate planning and management instruments that they mark the path towards adaptation and resilience, through the elaboration and implementation of six sector plans and four sector guides on climate change.</p>
<p>With the implementation of these sectoral instruments, we seek that, in the medium term, every program, project or undertaking, public or private, integrates the climate as an intrinsic variable from the earliest stages of its idea, design and planning. For this, it joins the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) as a key agent of change in climate action, together with the Ministries and governing institutions that have assumed sectoral commitments.</p>
<p>The convergence of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Agreement, the new global framework for biodiversity and recovery from the COVID 19 crisis, offers the opportunity for, placing sustainability and climate action at the center of management economic and social, we will overcome the barriers of poverty and inequality, which, together with the climate threat, constitute urgent challenges for the government and Panamanian society as a whole.</p>
<p>With the commitments presented by Panama in the Updated CRC1, we heed the call of the Paris Agreement to increase the level of ambition. Meeting this challenge requires progress in innovative forms of regional and global collaboration that allow us to accelerate the climate response, maximizing access to and efficiency of public climate finance, and creating conditions to mobilize private climate investment on a large scale.</p>
<p>Milciades Concepción, Minister of the Environment</p>


<h2 id="resumen-ejecutivo">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>

<p>The Republic of Panama is a diverse and multicultural country, distinguished by a dynamic of economic growth supported by a sophisticated offer of logistics and financial services. The country remains firm in the strategic decision to commit to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (UNFCCC). The vulnerability of the country to the effects of climate change, both at the level of its physical structures, and of the ecosystem and anthropogenic services platform that sustains the national economy, requires an increase in the level of climate ambition to guarantee the sustainability and competitiveness of the country in the long term, in a development scenario that to be sustainable has to be resilient to the climate.</p>
<p>Following up on the commitments made by the country in the framework of the Paris Agreement (PA), the update of the first Nationally Determined Contribution of Panama (CDN1) is innovative, fair and ambitious, since it is based on a integrated, in which actions for adaptation and mitigation are complemented to build resilience and move towards carbon neutrality in the country by 2050, generating triple benefits. That is, they produce multiple and tangible results in the areas of economic development, social well-being and environmental sustainability, gender equality, and the empowerment of women, youth, and vulnerable groups, by minimizing the damage caused by the impacts of climate change. and at the same time maximizing the opportunities that climate finance offers.</p>
<p>At the same time, it represents an opportunity to reflect greater climate ambition and solve the multidimensional problems linked to lack of equity, existing social inequalities, gender and intergenerational gaps and poverty that continue to affect the country and limit the sustainability of development. . From this perspective, in Panama development and the reduction of poverty and inequality are central elements of climate adaptation and mitigation, as well as the commitment to guarantee human rights and incorporate gender equality as a transversal axis to promote the development of sustainable climate policies, strategies and actions.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the Updated CDN1 presented by the Republic of Panama in 2020 is the incorporation of a broader concept of climate change and resilience in planning for the development of the country, proposing a transformational process of all economic, social and productive dynamics Panamanian to advance circularity, resilience and progressive reduction of emissions. For this, actions are proposed in ten sectors and / or strategic areas for integrated climate action, with GHG and non-GHG goals, which are expected to provide multiple ecosystem services, as well as significant improvements in emissions from transport and implementation of standards. climate and efficiency. For it,</p>
<p>It should be noted that the sectoral commitments raised have been the result of a broad process of participation, dialogue and consensus, in which the increase in climate ambition has taken into account the political and sectoral priorities, capacities, barriers and existing gaps, as well as to all sectors: public sector including central government entities and local governments, private sector, youth, academia, civil society and non-governmental organizations, in order to propose commitments according to national circumstances and that demonstrate Panama's climate commitment and your people.</p>
<p>In view of the above, the twenty-nine (29) commitments presented in the Updated CDN1 are structured around ten sectors and strategic areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Energy,</li>
<li>Forests,</li>
<li>Integrated Management of Hydrographic Basins,</li>
<li>Marine-Coastal System,</li>
<li>Biodiversity,</li>
<li>Sustainable Agriculture, Livestock and Aquaculture,</li>
<li>Resilient Human Settlements,</li>
<li>Public health,</li>
<li>Sustainable Infrastructure and</li>
<li>Circular Economy,</li>
</ul>

<p>Including two commitments to strengthen capacities for climate transparency on the determination of losses and damages, and the monitoring and evaluation of climate data that strengthen decision-making for climate action.</p>
<p>Like other countries in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region, Panama has an asymmetric position in relation to climate change, being a country highly vulnerable to its effects mainly due to its geography, while at the same time it has had a minor contribution to the problem, with a contribution to global GHG emissions in the order of 0.036%.</p>



<p>Following the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities and complying with the provisions of article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement, the country presents a GHG commitment to contribute to the mitigation of global climate change, by advancing towards an absolute goal of reducing emissions for the economy as a whole, prioritizing the Energy and LULUCF (Forests) sectors, which have the greatest impact on national emissions trends. With the commitment of amounts associated with GHG, the total emissions of the Energy sector will be reduced with respect to the trend scenario (BAU) by an estimated total of 60 million tons of CO2 equivalent accumulated between 2022-2050 and up to 10 million tons of CO2 equivalent accumulated between 2022-2030.</p>
<p>This global contribution to mitigation is complemented by a prioritization of the sectors and strategic areas of the economy that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and that at the same time represent an opportunity for economic diversification and for the start of the national planning process for the adaptation in each one of them. These integrated adaptation-mitigation commitments constitute a significant improvement compared to the CRC1 presented in 2016 and contribute directly to the objective of Article 2 of the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>As part of this vision, Panama recognizes that when adopting measures to face climate change, its respective obligations regarding human rights, the right to health, and the rights of indigenous peoples must be respected, promoted and taken into consideration. , local communities, migrants, children, people with disabilities and people in situations of vulnerability and the right to development, as well as gender equality, the empowerment of women and intergenerational equity. To achieve this objective, Panama is committed to incorporating the gender and human rights approach in mitigation and adaptation programs and projects in order to promote a society with low carbon emissions where the efforts of men and women in management are made visible. climatic,</p>



<p>The CDN1 update was carried out in the global, regional and national context marked by the recovery agenda in the face of the COVID 19 crisis and the losses and damages of the 2020 hurricane season. To face the post-2020 situation, a Plan was developed for Economic Recovery 2020 with actions for the immediate, short and medium term, with a series of policies to mitigate the economic effects that seek to support vulnerable segments of the population. In addition, Panama joined the "Platform for Redesign 2020" to design and implement recovery measures from the coronavirus pandemic, while addressing measures related to climate change and advancing in three main transitions: towards a decarbonized society, towards a circular economy and towards a decentralized society.</p>
<p>In summary, the Updated CDN1 of Panama is built from three key aspirations:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>The commitment to generate a climate policy that is not generic, but has measurable, verifiable and reportable indicators, to prioritize and evaluate policies throughout the national economy.</li>
<li>Breaking the dichotomy or separation between mitigation and adaptation, promoting multidisciplinarity, complementarity and multisectorality, through an integrated adaptation-mitigation approach.</li>
<li>Link climate action with efforts to reduce inequality and poverty, promoting a green and resilient economic recovery.</li>
</ol>

<p>To advance in the fulfillment of the commitments presented, adaptive management will be applied in light of national circumstances and needs, responding to gender, participation and transparency issues, taking into consideration vulnerable groups, communities and ecosystems, as required. stipulated in the Paris Agreement. Likewise, the requirements of the Paris Agreement will be addressed in relation to the guidelines on information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTC) related to the respective CRC of each Party and the guidelines for adaptation communications (Decisions 4 / CMA.1 and 9 / CMA.1 respectively), with a view to participating in the Global Balance process as of 2023, and improving access to sources of international climate finance.</p>



<h2 id="introducción">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Climate change is the global challenge of our generation, and facing it requires the commitment of all countries and people, without distinctions or exclusions of any kind. The Republic of Panama, in compliance with the commitments acquired before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement (PA), presents the update of the First Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN1).</p>
<p>With the presentation of the Updated CDN1 in 2020, Panama is preparing to follow the guidelines established in article 4 of the Paris Agreement and the Enhanced Transparency framework (MRT) that includes the presentation of National Inventory Reports (IIN), Biennial Reports of Transparency (IBT) and report of the progress of the Contributions Determined at the National Level (CDN).</p>
<p>For the updating process, the guidelines established in the guidelines for the purposes of clarity, transparency, understanding and for adaptation communications have been taken into account (Decisions 4 / CMA.1, 1 / CP.21 and 9 / CMA.1 ). Likewise, the recommendations of the instances and support organizations have been incorporated regarding elements considered essential to increase the level of ambition and the robustness of the information.</p>


<p>The first sections present information on the national context, a description of the process of updating the CRC1, the principles that have guided it and how the increased level of ambition is reflected. Starting in section 4, the specific future commitments for the entire economy are described in detail, expressed at the sectoral level and in strategic areas, under an integrated adaptation-mitigation approach, including a GHG commitment. For the sake of clarity, the commitments are presented separately into sectoral commitments and capacity-building commitments for climate action and transparency.</p>
<p>For each commitment, a brief description of the context is included with reference to the circumstances of the corresponding sector or strategic area, followed by a summary table that includes the commitment to its goal, the governing entity, the type of commitment, preliminary indicators and the SDGs to be achieved. those who contribute. The description of each commitment is complemented by a brief indicative reference to operational aspects related to the means of implementation, their potential for adaptation-mitigation integration, and ends with a statement of long-term ambition.</p>
<p>Annex A includes information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of the Updated Panama CDN1, a tabular summary of all commitments is included, indicating for each one: coverage data (description and objectives, sectors covered, geographical framework , temporal horizon); national circumstances (enabling political framework and implementing entities); commitment status (status, planned steps and implementation indicators); effects (benefits in adaptation and benefits in mitigation).</p>
<p>In attention to the permanent process of learning, implementation, evaluation and adjustment with which Panama advances climate action, the Updated CDN1 incorporates elements related to gender and equity, which allow us to advance in the national objectives of the fight against poverty and inequality, within the national planning framework for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the 2030 Agenda. Likewise, the very special situation of the COVID 19 pandemic is incorporated into the context elements, which has required a rethinking and rearrangement of the planning and state administration to face the critical situation and the post-2020 recovery scenario.</p>


<h3 id="panorama-nacional-de-desarrollo">NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OVERVIEW</h3>


<p>This section presents a brief summary of the general context of the country at the time of the CDN1 update. Detailed and expanded information is available in the Second Biennial Update Report (2IBA) of Panama, in the Third National Communication (MiAMBIENTE, 2018) and related national reports presented to the UNFCCC.</p>

<h4 class="heading" id="perfil-geográfico">1.1 Geographical profile</h4>

<p>The territory of the Republic of Panama comprises the land surface, the territorial sea, the underwater continental shelf and the air space between Colombia and Costa Rica in accordance with the boundary treaties signed between Panama and these two States. Panama is located in the northern hemisphere, in the intertropical zone near the Equator. The Republic of Panama is geographically located in the low northern latitudes, that is, between 7 ° 12'07 "and 9 ° 38'46" North latitude and 77 ° 09'24 "and 83 ° 03'07 ' ´ of western longitude.</p>
<p>Panama has a continental and insular territory of 75,517 km2, its shape is similar to a flat capital "S" and presents a direction from east to west, contrary to the direction of the rest of the Central American countries, which are presented from north to south. It is arranged in a west-east direction, limits to the North with the Caribbean Sea, to the South with the Pacific Ocean, to the East with Colombia and to the West with Costa Rica. 70% of the national territory is occupied by the lowlands and hills of less than 700 meters above sea level and is made up of the extensive plains of Chiriquí, Veraguas, the Azuero peninsula, Coclé and the coastal plains of the Caribbean. The remaining 30% corresponds to lands above 700 meters above sea level, which include the central mountain range with elevations among which the Barú volcano stands out, which has the highest elevation in the country (3, 475 masl), Cerro Fábrega (3,375 masl) and Cerro Echandi (3,163 masl), towards the West; towards the East, the eastern arc of the North that includes the Sierra Llorona de Portobelo, the San Blas mountain range and the Tacarcuna mountain range and the eastern arch of the South that includes the Serranía del Sapo, the Serranía de Majé and the Serranía de Pirre ( MyAMBIENTE, 2018).</p>
<p>The territory is divided into ten provinces (Bocas del Toro, Coclé, Colón, Chiriquí, Darién, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama, West Panama and Veraguas), 81 districts or municipalities, 679 townships (two districts with a corregimiento level: Kuna de Madugandi and Kuna de Wargandi and three indigenous comarcas with province category: Guna Yala, Emberá-Wounaan and Ngäbe-Buglé) (INEC, 2019).</p>

<h4 class="heading" id="clima">1.2 Climate</h4>

<p>The Panamanian territory presents a uniform tropical climate throughout the year with a seasonality determined by the precipitation patterns marking the Panamanian climate between dry and rainy seasons. Average annual temperature values ​​range between 23 and 27 ° C, with maximums of up to 33 ° C for coastal areas, and at higher elevations the values ​​can drop to 16 ° C. The temperature in Panama is mainly defined by the topography of the territory where it increases about 0.56 ° C for every 100 m of altitude. (TCNCC, 2018). On the other hand, rainfall varies between 1,500 and 3,000 mm per year, with variations according to the topography and oceanic influence; on the Caribbean side, rainfall is higher than on the Pacific side. In Panama, the rainfall regime greatly influences productive activities, the location of forests, biodiversity, among others. Three rainfall regions are identified (Pacific, Central and Atlantic), each with its own characteristics.</p>



<p>The great oceanic masses of the Atlantic and the Pacific are responsible for the high humidity content of the environment, and due to the narrowness of the strip that separates both oceans, the Panamanian climate has a great maritime influence. Regarding the meteorology, the semi-permanent anticyclone of the North Atlantic significantly affects the climatic conditions of our country, since from this system the northeast trade winds are generated that in the lower layers of the atmosphere reach our country, sensibly determining the climate of the country (ETESA, 2009).</p>
<p>According to the National Climate Change Strategy 2050, the main effects associated with climate change include risks from sea level rise and hydro-meteorological events. Regarding the rise in sea level, current critical situations are already facing vulnerable indigenous populations. A critical case is the situation of the Guna Yala Region, an archipelago located on the Caribbean coast of the country, for which since 2014 the need to plan displacement processes from the archipelago to the continental zone has been documented (Displacement, 2014). Coastal risk modeling tools suggest flood scenarios in 2050 that compromise critical areas of the canal operation in Panama City.</p>



<h4 class="heading" id="características-socio-económicas">1.3 Socio-economic characteristics</h4>

<p>According to data from the Strategic Government Plan (PEG) 2019-2024, the Panamanian economy has developed as a service economy, and that is where its comparative advantage lies. The transit center constitutes 83% of GDP, 90% of service exports, and 65% of the population. The logistics activity is constituted by the transshipment, storage, consolidation, repackaging, assembly and redistribution in ports, Colon Free Zone, Panama Pacifico, City of Knowledge and export processing zones (PEG 2019). This vocation of transit and connectivity positions the country as an access platform to the Latin America and the Caribbean (LA&amp;C) region.</p>
<p>Since 1990, Panama has had an exceptional economic performance. It has consistently led the region in economic growth rate, with 5.9% on average per year. At the same time, Panama has undergone a structural transformation of its economy, in which the construction, financial and logistics services sectors, as well as retail and wholesale trade have made the greatest contribution to growth. The agricultural sector, one of the sectors with the highest percentage of employment, with 14.4% of all jobs, has constantly fallen in its contribution to GDP, going from 6.2% in 2005 to 3.1% in 2015 and between 2016 and 2019 it has been kept at 2%. At the same time, between 2015 and 2019 the transport, construction and retail and wholesale trade sectors, which in 2019 registered 35% of employment, their share in GDP has increased, or has remained relatively constant. Transportation from 13% to 14%, construction 14% and retail and wholesale trade 18% (INDH, 2019).</p>
<p>According to data from the World Report on Human Development 2019, from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Panama is ranked 67 in the Human Development Index (HDI) of 189 countries and territories, which places it in the group of countries with high HDI.</p>
<p>Panama has made significant progress in reducing poverty. The general poverty rate in 2017 stood at 20.7%, and in the case of extreme poverty in 2017, a rate of 9.8% was presented (MEF, 2019), due in part to economic growth and public transfers. Using the poverty line of US $ 5.5 per day, between the years 2015-2018, there was a decrease in poverty from 15.4% to 12.6%, while extreme poverty, set at US $ 3.2 per day , declined from 6.7% to 5.2%. Although the urban-rural gaps have decreased, they remain wide: the poverty rate is almost double in the rural population (40.8%) than in the country as a whole (20.7%) and in the indigenous population it is four times superior (82%). (IDB, 2019)</p>
<p>Despite progress in the fight against poverty, Panama remains one of the most unequal countries in the world. The high inequality that exists in Panama and its persistence are closely related to the strong territorial imbalances that exist in the country, being one of the countries with the greatest territorial differences in Latin America. (IDB 2019). This inequality translates into vulnerability, with women, people with disabilities and indigenous peoples being the populations in the most vulnerable conditions.</p>
<p>The population in Panama as of July 1, 2018 was estimated at 4,158,783, the total of men is 2,085,950 representing 50.2% and that of women is 2,072,833 representing 49.8% (MINSA, 2019a). By 2018, the indigenous population represented 12.3% of the total and the Afro-descendant population 9.2%. Of the total population, women and girls represent 49.77% according to the 2010 census. According to data from UN Women, the country's gender inequality index is 0.58 and 0.87 in indigenous areas, which gives an average of 0.73 and qualifies Panama as a country with high gender inequality. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately one in every five people in Panama was in a situation of multidimensional poverty7. But for the indigenous population the incidence of multidimensional poverty is extremely high: 93. 7% of Guna women, 89.8% of Ngäbe Buglé women and 70.9% of Emberá women were in multidimensional poverty. (UN Women, nd)</p>
<p>Regarding the health profile of its population, Panama is in full demographic transition with epidemiological polarization, that is, with a double burden of disease, on the one hand, communicable diseases are prevalent in the rural and poor population and chronic diseases -degenerative are on the rise, as is to be expected in aging populations. Life expectancy at birth is 77.7 years with important differences according to sex. For men it is 74.8 years and 80.9 for women. Regarding universal health coverage, the coverage estimates assign 60% of the population to the Social Security Fund and 40% to the Ministry of Health, which in addition to being a service provider is also the Governing Body of the National Health System. Health. (MINSA, 2018).</p>




<p>The Panamanian agricultural sector is diverse, however, production is concentrated in some specific items. In terms of volume, sugar cane, bananas, rice, plantains and corn stand out; however, the products that add the most value are beef and pork, bananas, rice and sugar cane. According to World Bank data, between 2010 and 2015 the share of agriculture in Panama's GDP was, on average, 3.3%, below the average of 5.2% for Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite the modest contribution of the agricultural sector to the Panamanian economy, more than 33.3% of the total population of Panama (about 1.3 million people) lives in rural areas, according to information from the World Bank. According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), the 39. 8% of the rural population lives in conditions of poverty; which contrasts with urban areas where 9.3% of the urban population is in such conditions. Therefore, a large part of the country's poverty is concentrated in rural areas. Likewise, 9% of female workers and 20% of male workers are engaged in agricultural activities (World Bank, 2018), which results in 15.7% of the population working in this sector. (IDB, 2019) 7% of the population work in this sector. (IDB, 2019) 7% of the population work in this sector. (IDB, 2019)</p>


<p>Additionally, the conditions of unequal opportunities to face natural hazards, the distribution of poverty, the need for greater monitoring of works or actions to counteract climatic effects, as well as the challenge of greater coordination among all stakeholders. , make the conditions of vulnerability increase and are expressed more significantly in the population with limited resources, mostly adults, particularly women or children in a state of poverty, as well as the need for more basic services and strengthening programs of local capacities.</p>
<p>The Panama Canal basin, key to the country's economy, has registered a temperature increase of 0.5%, with a reduction of up to 20% in the flows of the Chagres River that provides water for the locks of the waterway and for the consumption of almost two million people in Panama, Colón and Panama Oeste. These threats translate into specific situations of water availability in summer, a greater demand for energy in the face of high temperatures, potential loss of crops and soils and consequent increase in the agricultural frontier; additionally, the greater probability of extreme events that can affect the populations of the basin and structures for the operation of the Canal.</p>



<h4 class="heading" id="panamá-en-cifras">1.4 Panama in figures</h4>

<p>Below is a summary of the main national indicators.</p>
<p>Regarding data disaggregated by sex and indicators that characterize the economic and social situation of women in Panama, in regular social conditions, various studies show the existing gender gap between men and women in the country (UN Women, 2020). In 2018, 18.6% of women were in a situation of multidimensional poverty, being the Indigenous Comarcas and the provinces of Bocas del Toro and Darién where the conditions of poverty have the greatest impact, while in the provinces of Los Santos and Herrera they are Women are in less impoverished situations (INEC, Household Survey 2018).</p>
<p>Inequalities between men and women suggest a situation of feminization of poverty, where differences in terms of own income, unemployment, underemployment and land tenure are just some areas that show gender inequality. According to information provided by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the value of the HDI for women corresponding to Panama in 2018 is 0.794, while for men it is 0.790, and, consequently, the value of the Index of Gender Development is 1,005. On the other hand, the 2010 HDI introduced the Gender Inequality Index, which reflects gender-based inequalities in three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity. Panama obtained a value of 0.460 in the Gender Inequality Index,</p>
<p>Other data disaggregated by gender for Panama indicates that 18.3% of parliamentary seats are held by women, and 74.8% of adult women have reached at least secondary education, compared to 68.4% of their male counterparts. For every 100,000 live births, 94 women die from causes related to pregnancy, and the fertility rate among adolescents is 81.8 births for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19. The participation of women in the labor market is 52.5%, compared to 80.5% of men.</p>
<p>The National Disaster Risk Management Plan includes Gender Equity and Pluriculturality among its strategic principles, so it is necessary to move forward analyzing the differentiated vulnerability of women and men, in their diversity, before climate impacts; their roles and differentiated contributions to disaster risk management and their contributions to development and climate resilience processes. The explicit incorporation of gender considerations in climate actions that derive from the commitments established in the Updated CRC1 is a concrete way of advancing gender equity from climate action.</p>

<h3><strong>POLICY FRAMEWORK AND ENABLING CONDITIONS FOR A SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT</strong></h3>



<p>The Updated Panama CDN1 benefits from an enabling framework of public policy, regulations and general and sectoral planning for climate action and sustainable development. Prior to the presentation of the CRC1 in 2016, the country's commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs was formalized through Executive Decree 393 of 2015 that adopts the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and dictates other provisions. In alignment with this sustainable development agenda, a National Strategic Plan with a State Vision “Panama 2030” (PEN 2030) was prepared within the Council of the National Agreement for Development and the Government Strategic Plan 2019-2024.</p>
<p>At the time of updating the CDN1, the country has environmental regulations framed in the Single Text of General Law 41 of the Environment of 1998 (Law 8 of 2015) created by the Ministry of the Environment. Through the Paris Agreement ratified by Law 40 of 2016, the National Climate Change Strategy 2050 and the National Climate Change Policy under review, and Executive Decree 100 of October 20, 2020, which regulates the chapter on Change Mitigation Global Climate of the General Environmental Law and creates the National Reduce Your Footprint Program for the management and monitoring of low-carbon economic and social development in the Republic of Panama.</p>
<p>This Mitigation regulation also creates the National Platform for Climate Transparency (PNTC), attached to the National Environmental Information System (SINIA), establishes the parameters by which the preparation of national inventories of GHG emissions by sources and removals by carbon sinks and raises the institutional arrangements for the update, presentation, implementation, monitoring and reporting of the successive CDNs of Panama.</p>
<p>This general framework is complemented by an extensive corpus of public policy instruments and sector regulations in implementation, which includes policy documents, plans, strategies, and legal and regulatory frameworks for each of the ten sectors and prioritized cross-cutting strategic areas. The list of relevant sectoral policy guiding instruments includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Energy Plan (PEN) 2015-2050</li>
<li>Energy Transition Agenda (2020-2030)</li>
<li>National Forest Strategy 2018-2050</li>

</li><li>Public Policy of Equal Opportunities for Women.</li>
</ul>



<h4>
2.1 Process of updating the CRC1, principles and guiding approaches</h4>

<p>To update the CDN1, including the design, establishment of commitments and their socialization, a broad, systematic and multisectoral consultation and validation process was carried out, led by the MiAMBIENTE. Each commitment was discussed and agreed with the sector institution responsible for its implementation. In addition to the institutional work sessions for the design, definition and adjustment of commitments, nine interactive virtual workshops for active listening were held with the private sector, public sector, local governments, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community and young people, in which they participated. more than three hundred people, with evidence of participation of at least 53% women and 47% men. Prior to its formalization,</p>
<p>The process of updating the CDN1 resulted in the establishment of twenty-nine (29) structured commitments around ten (10) sectors and strategic areas prioritized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Woods</li>
<li>Integrated Watershed Management</li>
<li>Marine-Coastal System</li>
<li>Biodiversity</li>
<li>Sustainable Agriculture, Livestock and Aquaculture</li>
<li>Resilient Human Settlements</li>
<li>Public health</li>
<li>Sustainable Infrastructure</li>
<li>Circular Economy</li>
</ul>

<p>Also including two (2) commitments to strengthen capacities for climate transparency, in terms of determining losses and damages, and monitoring and evaluating climate risks and low-emission development in Panama.</p>
<p><img src="./PAN-TR_files/PAN-NDC1_2.png"></p>


<p>The principles and methodological approaches that guided the updating of the CDN1 are:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Integrated adaptation-mitigation approach: refers to the need to demonstrate how each of the ten prioritized sectors and strategic areas can reduce emissions, while promoting synergies and potential benefits in resilience of populations and improvement of livelihoods, generates Green jobs and triggers improvement of results in health, education, and reduction of inequality.</p></li>
<li><p>Participatory and gender-sensitive planning and decision-making approach for resilient and inclusive development: refers to the definition of contributions and the mechanisms for their implementation are agreed with national, sectoral and local actors, ensuring broad participation and distributing burdens and opportunities, in the most equitable and fair way possible, while recognizing gender as an essential issue and taking into account norms, gender roles and inequalities as part of its objectives.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Nature-based solutions and green infrastructure approach: refers to nature-based solutions (NBS) that include those actions that integrate ecosystems and the services they provide, to respond to various societal challenges such as climate change , food security or disaster risk. The “green infrastructure” constitutes a good alternative or complement to the conventional engineering approaches, known “hard” engineering or “gray” infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ol>




<h4>TOWARDS A NEW LEVEL OF CLIMATE AMBITION</h4>
<p>The vision that guided the CDN1 update process is the resilience and progressive reduction of carbon dioxide emissions towards the country's carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>


<p>In the Third National Communication on Climate Change of Panama, it is indicated that Panama ranks 14th among the countries with the highest exposure to multiple natural hazards, with 15% of its area and 12.5% ​​of its total population, exposed to two or more threats. . In keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, even though Panama does not have a significant contribution to global GHG emissions, the Updated CDN1 is fair and ambitious since it includes a reduction commitment in the energy sector, which is the largest issuer in the country and establishes actions to increase transparency by clarifying absorption figures. Likewise, the Updated Panama CDN1 represents an increase in the level of ambition compared to the 2016 CDN1,</p>


<p>In parallel to the specific commitments assumed by the country, by 2025 an additional set of regulations, instruments and actions relevant to climate action will be in implementation that are currently in the process of preparation and formalization, which includes:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>The modernization of environmental management instruments based on the conceptual framework of climate change and climate variability analysis.</li>
<li>Officialization of the national map of climate risks and vulnerability indicators (differentiated by sex and age as appropriate).</li>
<li>Formulation of the preliminary draft of the Framework Law on Climate Change and updating of the National Climate Change Policy of Panama to 2050.</li>
<li>Low Carbon Economic and Social Development Strategy to 2050.</li>
<li>Regulation of the provisions of Adaptation of the General Law of Environment.</li>
<li>In conjunction with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF):</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
Implementation of the climate change tagger in the budget to allow the measurement of climate spending and financing and to identify the way in which financing flows and the final destination by sector,
</li>
<li>
Guide and procedure for incorporating climate variability and climate change variables into the National Public Investment System (SINIP).
</li>
</ul>

<p>Gender aspects </p>

<p>  In response to the provisions of the Paris Agreement (PA) in that the Parties must promote gender equality and include adaptation measures in this regard, the Updated CRC1 recognizes the transformational role that women have for climate action and with This is the importance of advancing in the inclusion of gender equality in it. It is stated that the country is advancing a National Gender Action Plan that will facilitate addressing mitigation and adaptation actions with a rights and equity approach.</p>




<h3 id="compromisos-sectoriales-de-acción-climática">SECTORAL COMMITMENTS TO CLIMATE ACTION</h3>

<p>In Panama, the most important sectors in terms of GHG emissions and removals (current or future), are the Energy sector (electricity generation and land transport) and the sector of activities related to Land Use, Change in the use of Land and Forestry (LULUCF), where deforestation and forest degradation play an important role. For this reason and in coherence with the contribution presented in 2016, the Updated CDN1 continues the efforts in both sectors, with an increased level of ambition.</p>
<p>From an adaptation perspective, the specific objective pursued with the update of Panama's CDN1 is to promote climate resilience and reduce the risk of the effects of climate change. CRC1 will be progressive and implemented through a participatory and transparent, inclusive and gender-sensitive approach, based on our national and sectoral circumstances.</p>
<p>The commitments by sector or strategic area are detailed below.</p>

<h4>4.1 Energy Sector</h4>

<p>In Panama, the Energy sector takes into account emissions from stationary combustion and mobile sources from the burning of various types of fuels. It is the largest GHG emitter, according to the greenhouse gas inventory data (INGEI) of Panama (MiAMBIENTE, 2020).</p>

<h5> 4.1.1 Sectorial circumstances</h5>

<p>The Republic of Panama is a country with an economy based on trade and service. In 2019, national energy consumption by sector was distributed as follows: 47.4% represented transportation, 19% industrial, 17.1% commercial and public services, 16% residential, and 0.5% others (SNE, 2019). To satisfy this demand, the national energy supply came mainly from imported sources in 82.3% (oil derivatives, coal and natural gas) and from natural resources in 17.7% (hydro-energy, wind, solar, biogas, bagasse and firewood), according to the 2019 energy balance. It is evident that Panama has a diversified energy matrix, however, it still depends considerably on the import of fossil fuels and, therefore, is subject to the volatility of world prices.</p>
<p>Of the total energy supply (38,918 Kboe), 48.7% was directed to electricity generation. The installed capacity by type of source in 2019 was 43.9% (hydroelectric), 24.9% (oil derivatives), 10.3% (coal), 9.3% (natural gas) and 11.6% (non-conventional renewable energies, distributed in 6.6% wind, 4.8% solar, 0.2% biogas). It is important to highlight that these numbers are close (77% of the goal to 2030) to the commitment presented in 2016 in the CDN1 of Panama on 15% of Non-Conventional Renewable Energies (NCRE) to 2030.</p>
<p>Taking 2014 as the base year where the participation of ERNC was 2.1%, in 2019 an increase in participation of ERNC of 9.5% is reflected. It is important to highlight that multiple measures of direct impact have been carried out to achieve this increase in NCRE, among them a series of fiscal incentives for the promotion of hydroelectric generation that include mini-plants, wind, solar and natural gas plants. , as well as the modification of the energy and power purchase rules. Additionally, there are energy efficiency measures such as the definition of fourteen (14) energy efficiency indices, current technical standards and regulations for air conditioning and refrigeration, with their respective energy labeling, current technical regulations for sustainable building,</p>


<p>However, the Energy sector still has a series of challenges that it must overcome, including: 1) closing the energy access gap in the country, 2) reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and making greater use of the potential of renewable energies the country has, 3) attend to the quality of electricity service, which has been affected by the growth of the population and its concentration in Panama City, San Miguelito, Arraiján, David and Colón, 4) reduce the electricity and hydrocarbon subsidies, maintaining electricity and fuel prices acceptable to the end user, 5) mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which in 2017 corresponded to approximately 57% of the sector's emissions,6) adapt the energy sector to the adverse effects of climate change such as increases in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns, which have the potential to impact the demand, distribution, transmission and generation of energy.</p>


<p><em>National planning process for commitment preparation</em></p>
<p>For the preparation of the contribution of the Energy sector, the National Energy Plan 2015-2050 and the Strategic Guidelines of the Energy Transition Agenda (ATE) 2020-2030 were taken as a reference, which, to date, are the medium-sized planning instruments. and long term of this sector.</p>


<p><img src="./PAN-TR_files/PAN-NDC1_3.png"></p>
<p>The Strategic Guidelines of the ATE 2020-2030, propose the eight (8) National Strategies that will serve as roadmaps to take the energy sector towards a transition in which it becomes affordable, accessible, reliable, safe and sustainable for Panamanians . These are: 1) Universal Access, 2) Rational and Efficient Use of Energy, 3) Electric Mobility, 4) Distributed Generation, 5) Innovation of the National Interconnected System (SIN), 6) Panama as Energy Hub (natural gas hub and green energy hub), 7) Modernization of the regulatory framework of the hydrocarbon sector and 8) Institutional strengthening. The ATE was made official through Cabinet Resolution 93 of 2020.</p>

<p>For the construction of a new commitment it was necessary to evaluate two scenarios <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> :</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trend scenario (BAU):</strong> scenario based on the Post COVID19 economic reactivation packages with investments in conventional infrastructure. It assumes Panama as a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) distribution hub; and it does not consider specific investments in renewables and energy efficiency, more than the policy instruments already foreseen and the advancement of Electric Mobility is considered without additional incentives to the pilots already foreseen. Energy consumption and GDP follow historical trends.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scenario of the Energy Transition Agenda (ATE):</strong> scenario based on the objectives of the ATE (Energy Transition Agenda) <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and its consultative tables; Post COVID-19 economic reactivation package with investments in conventional infrastructure and NCRE climate investments, energy efficiency and electric mobility, the evolution of the public transport system is established according to the Integrated Plan for Sustainable Urban Mobility (PIMUS).</p></li>
</ol>



<p>It should be noted that due to the health crisis that the world is experiencing, it is assumed that these scenarios set in motion the economic reactivation packages as of 2022 and that energy demand begins to decouple from economic growth in the ATE scenario as a result of the policies proposed for the sector. The ATE 2020-2030 seeks to be the new route of decarbonization and climate resilience of the energy sector in the Republic of Panama and will focus on strategic guidelines prioritized by the Government of Panama both for climate action and national energy policy as well as for economic reactivation Post-COVID-19.</p>
<p>In this sense, according to the analyzes for the ATE 2020-2030, the climate investments necessary to achieve the objectives set in this scenario, on average, are 1.5% of GDP by 2050 and will allow accumulated savings in subsidies of around B /. 2MM by 2030 and B / .10.5MM by 2050, with the potential to create new direct and indirect jobs in the energy sector of approximately 35 thousand jobs by 2030 and 100 thousand jobs by 2050. The implementation of the ATE 2020 -2030 will generate a decrease in air pollution, leading to fewer Panamanians suffering from respiratory diseases, a higher quality of life especially in the post-COVID19 period and lower costs for the health system quantified in an accumulated saving of B / .43 million by 2030 and B / .195 million by 2050.With these figures, the economic advantages that making climate investments of this nature would bring to the fore, however, they are ambitious goals that require a country commitment.</p>
<p>From the environmental point of view, Panama will achieve a reduction in total emissions from the country's energy sector by at least 24% by 2050 and by at least 11.5% by 2030, with respect to the BAU scenario, which represent an estimated 60 million tons of CO2 equivalents accumulated between 2022-2050 and up to 10 million tons of CO2 equivalents accumulated between 2022-2030. It is important to highlight that the ATE 2020-2030 is an instrument that will require international support to break financial and transfer barriers climate technologies and capacity building.</p>
<p>On the other hand, considering the potential that the sector presents for the mitigation-adaptation integration approach, in addition to the energy transition policy instruments that provide a clear potential for national GHG mitigation, progress is being made in the adaptation policy instruments of the sector. The transformation of the energy sector to a low-emission one, coupled with planning that considers and adapts to future risks due to climate change, will result in a resilient energy sector, guaranteeing a secure supply to meet the growing needs of society.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Republic of Panama begins its national and sectoral planning in matters of adaptation and undertakes to establish a Climate Change Plan for the Energy sector, based on the Energy Transition Agenda and the National Energy Plan 2015-2050, which It is emerging as the planning instrument for the operation of the energy system, contributing to the sector's climate resilience and contributing to the sector's decarbonization path.</p>
<p>The process of updating the commitment of the Energy sector is based on the increase of national capacities in the field of INGEI, which resulted in a time series of INGEI for this sector that includes the period 1990-2017 (Ministry of the Environment, Second Biennial Update Report, 2020) and the Analysis of the Post-COVID19 Economic Reactivation and Energy Transition of Panama (National Secretary of Energy, 2020).

<h5>4.1.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>The Energy Transition Agenda (ATE) made official in November 2020 constitutes the roadmap for climate action in the sector. It indicates that "electric power can be considered as a human right that 93,000 Panamanian families still do not enjoy", which is why it is necessary to implement new technologies, innovate, educate and empower young people and women community leaders for sustainability of future investments in the energy sector. It is important that energy policies and strategies and national registries analyze the differentiated energy uses and uses of men and women, the differentiated impacts by gender of energy poverty, and gender roles in the energy sector. What's more,</p>
<p>Compliance with the commitment related to the National Climate Change Plan for the Energy sector will be carried out with its own resources and support from strategic partners of international cooperation. Additional climate financial resources are required to promote and scale other climate action measures in the areas of energy efficiency, electric mobility, use of photovoltaic solar panels / solar water heaters and sustainable construction, among others, to achieve the goal of reducing total emissions raised to 2030 and 2050.</p>
<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration: At the same time that measures to reduce GHG emissions are being implemented, progress is being made in adaptation by including climate change risks in energy sector planning, increasing the sector's own resilience and security in the availability of energy in the face of extreme events, while at the same time influencing the creation of green jobs.</p>
<p>Ambition: Partially decarbonized resilient energy matrix and implemented technological innovations.</p>



<h4>4.2 Forest Sector</h4>
<p>This sector includes activities on Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry, known by its acronym LULUCF. This sector is important for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. In Panama, in terms of mitigating climate change, the sector acts as a net sink for GHG and gross emissions indicate deforestation as the main source, especially the transition from natural forest to pasture. In addition, the sector has the potential to contribute to the reduction of vulnerability and the increase of climate resilience through adequate forest management and increase of forest cover in hydrographic basins, which generates a series of ecosystem services that benefit the most vulnerable communities and protect their livelihoods.</p>

<h5>4.2.1 Sectorial circumstances</h5>


<p>The LULUCF sector is strategic given that the Republic of Panama has 4,925,789.72 hectares of forests, which represent 65.40% of the national territory, which is why Panama belongs to the group of countries with the highest percentage of forest cover in the world, as indicated by the National Forest Strategy 2018-2050. Consequently, its importance in providing multiple ecosystem services; however, socio-economic activities such as agriculture exert strong pressure on forests.</p>

<p>The management of the forestry sector is framed within a regulatory framework with specific norms for conservation and reforestation, including financial mechanisms and incentives. These instruments include Law 69 of 2017 that creates the Incentive Program for forest coverage and conservation of natural forests, as well as the National Forest Strategy 2018-2050, under Executive Decree No. 20 of March 28, 2019, created to generate a long-term vision for the Forestry sector of Panama. For its part, the National Strategy for the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (ENREDD +) is in the validation stage as one of the key elements to implement this mechanism in the country.</p>

<p>Women and men use and depend on forests and products differently. Their gender roles and responsibilities determine their needs and preferences in relation to the sustainable management and conservation of forest resources. Gender relations also influence the use and control of resources, power structures, decision-making, opportunities for capacity building, access and control of technological resources and incentives, and livelihood strategies.</p>


<p><em>National planning process for the preparation of the commitment.</em></p>
<p>In 2019, the National Government presented the Strategic Government Plan 2019-2024 with 125 priority actions to execute during this administrative period. Action number 76 is the launch of the National Program for Reforestation of Water Producing Basins. Within this framework, the MiAMBIENTE Forestry Directorate coordinated the actions to formulate the National Forest Restoration Program (PNRF) corresponding to the 2021-2025 period.</p>
<p>The National Forest Restoration Program (PNRF) is a national instrument that is part of the objectives of Forest Law 1 of 1994, the Forest Policy, the reforestation modalities established in Law 69 of 2017 that creates the program of forest incentives, the National Forest Strategy, the National Forest Development Plan, the Alliance for the Million Hectares and the CDN1 presented in 2016, as part of the national commitments to the Paris Agreement. Currently, the Forestry Directorate is preparing the Forestry Master Plan in alignment with the previous instruments.</p>
<p>MiAMBIENTE, through the Forestry Directorate (DIFOR), is the governing body of the forestry sector in the Republic of Panama, therefore, the promoter and general coordinator of the National Forest Restoration Program (PNRF). It is important to note that the PRNF will consider existing coordination mechanisms, such as the National Forest Management Committee (CONAGEFOR). CONAGEFOR is emerging as a facilitator between public and private institutions to support the PNRF, the Alliance for the million hectares, the Forest Policy, the National Forest Strategy, the REFORESTA Fund, the ENREDD + and other sectoral instruments.</p>
<p>The progress of the Republic of Panama in terms of INGEI has strengthened the planning and formulation of public policy instruments and actions associated with the mitigation of climate change at the national level that are based on scientific information for decision-making.</p>
<p>For the LULUCF sector, Panama is committed to restoring 50,000 hectares nationwide, which will contribute to the absorption of approximately 2.6 million tons of CO2eq by 2050, an increase equivalent to 10% with respect to the average absorption for the period 1994-2017. .. The process of updating the LULUCF commitment is based on the increase in national capacities in the field of INGEI, which resulted in a time series of INGEI for this sector (MiAMBIENTE, 2020a), following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.</p>
<p>This represents an increase in the level of ambition with respect to the commitment of the CDN1 in 2016, since the transparency of the monitoring will be increased, through a monitoring system of restored hectares under the modalities of the PNRF 2021-2025, and its translation to tons of CO2 equivalent. The monitoring system will work through an application that will be used to monitor the reforestation and conservation activities carried out by MiAMBIENTE at the national level. For further details, refer to Annex A on information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of this Updated CDN1.</p>

<h5>4.2.3 Operational aspects</h5>


<p>The development and fulfillment of the reforestation goals of the National Forest Restoration Program (PNRF) is estimated at US $ 81,222,846.00. MiAMBIENTE will carry out actions at the national and international level to find and obtain funds for the management and execution of projects, their monitoring, follow-up, promotion and dissemination of reforestation actions in the country.</p>

<h4>4.3 integrated estion of river basins</h4>

<p>Under this strategic area, reference is made to the management of water resources, which constitutes one of the main engines of economic and human development in Panama as it is the pillar of the country's economy, agriculture and energy security.</p>

<h5> 4.3.1 Sectorial circumstances</h5>

<p>Panama is considered one of the countries with the highest water resources, with approximately 35,894 m3 of renewable freshwater resources per capita (GWP 2017). This abundance scenario is relative, since it hides a series of regional and seasonal limitations, specifically those associated with the area known as “Arco Seco”, the most arid region of the country. The scenario of relative abundance of current and future water coexists with serious conflicts due to competition for the use of water that tend to worsen, in quantity and intensity. In turn, this scenario of relative abundance of water and growing conflicts is aggravated by climate variability and extreme weather events, mainly droughts and floods.</p>



<p>According to statistical and meteorological records, since 2004 there has been an increase in the frequency of extreme events in the country, with hydro-meteorological events having affected the most different ecosystems, as well as the most vulnerable population, including women. boys and girls, people with disabilities, people in poverty and the elderly, in several priority watersheds at the national level. The crises resulting from extreme precipitation events that have occurred in recent years, including the events of La Purísima 2010, El Niño 2015, and the storm Otto 2016 and the storm ETA in 2020, have highlighted the vulnerability of the systems around the collection. , distribution and access to water.</p>
<p>Evidence of the dependence of the national economy on water resources is the operation of the Panama Canal, an energy generation matrix made up of 60.1% hydroelectricity and agriculture highly dependent on hydrological cycles, with little coverage of irrigation systems. By supporting logistics, transportation and financial services, water management is key to the socio-economic and environmental functioning of the country. Complementary sectors such as energy and tourism are also directly related to water management, for the use of resources and for ecosystem services (water supply, scenic beauty, recreational uses, others). From this perspective, the management of water resources is the basis of the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the country.</p>
<p>Water management in Panama is carried out based on an integrated water and basin management approach. The water-food-energy-climate nexus is widely recognized and has been applied in Panama to advance in a resilient management of water resources through the Program of Adaptation to Climate Change through Integrated Management of Water Resources in Panama in implementation since 2018 with resources from the Adaptation Fund. Despite the fact that the legal framework for water is outdated in terms of climate action, the sector has a long-term strategic instrument in implementation that can be the framework for said transformational adaptation towards a national model of water resilience, the National Plan for Water Security (PNSH) 2015-2050: Water for All (PNSH),</p>


<p>In addition to the legal gap, the resilience of the water sector faces other weaknesses related to the lack of a consolidated meteorological network aimed at generating a database for the study of climate change with a record of data disaggregated by sex that evidences the different vulnerabilities to which exposed by men and women, and lack of budget for the execution of research programs and planning of water resources at the level of hydrographic basins.</p>
<p>Regarding gender, the National Water Security Plan (PNSH) 2015-2050: Water for all, highlights that water scarcity exacerbates gender inequality, and in some cases causes child labor in girls. For this reason, Panama is committed to achieving equitable access to adequate sanitation and hygiene services for all people, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and people in vulnerable situations. To this end, the government will facilitate the participation of men, women, children and vulnerable groups in the management of the sustainable use of water resources at all levels and in the distribution of benefits, and a gender perspective will be integrated into the design and implementation of water resources management programs.</p>


<h5>4.3.2 Commitment</h5>

<p>The sectoral commitment implies the development of sectoral planning instruments, a national climate instrument and a sub-national ordering instrument, as follows:</p>

</table>






<h5>4.3.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>Both planning processes focused on priority basins contemplate the development of climate components such as vulnerability index, socioeconomic studies, climate change scenarios and climate risk assessment, among others, integrating them into the instruments used for their effective management, such as Detailed Diagnoses of the Hydrographic Basins, Territorial Environmental Planning Plans of the Hydrographic Basin and Management Plans. Its preparation is facilitated by the availability of official and updated data, strengthened basin committees and existing technical tools such as the groundwater map, the national map of degraded soils and forest cover and the methodological guide for the evaluation of the water footprint, among others.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee harmony between the planning and management instruments of natural resources implemented by the State, the Climate Change Plan for the integrated management of hydrographic basins will incorporate the vision of the PNSH. In this way, water security planning will be decentralized to the river basin level, particularly in relation to Goal 4 for Healthy Watershed Management.</p>
<p>The climate change Plan for the GICH will be supported by the national adaptation planning process with resources from the Green Climate Fund. The PIOTA of the CHCP is under development.</p>
<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration: Plans will emphasize the application of nature-based solutions, the application of which will result in increased resilience in prioritized watersheds, reduced emissions, and increased carbon storage through reforestation, afforestation, restoration of soils, sustainable management of forests and the conservation of forest carbon stocks.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Watersheds have restored soils with guaranteed quantity and quality of water resources, which allow the supply of the population and productive activities.</em></p>

<h4> 4.4 Marine-Coastal Systems</h4>

<p>This sector refers to the strategic management of marine and coastal resources that include the waters of the territorial sea, estuaries, submarine continental shelf, coastlines, bays, estuaries, mangroves, reefs, underwater vegetation, scenic beauties, biotic and abiotic resources within said waters and the coastal strip.</p>

<h5>4.4.1 Sectorial circumstances</h5>

<p>Panama has an extensive coastal zone with a length of 1,700.6 km in the Pacific and 1,287.7 km. In the Caribbean. The most common climate threats reported to the coastal zone are sea level rise, storm surges, cyclonic storms, strong winds, floods, droughts, landslides and earthquakes. Additionally, these threats also increase with the concurrence of the extreme effects temporarily produced by the El Niño weather phenomena. The effects on the infrastructures of fishing communities, events of saline intrusion and coastal erosion, among other damages, associated with weather events require the incorporation of a disaster risk reduction approach in the management of marine-coastal systems. Although there is insufficient data on the level of impact of climate change on marine-coastal ecosystems, there are important indications. For example, data from the San Cristóbal tide gauge station in Panama indicate a trend of sea level rise on a scale of increase of 1.4 mm per year (Biomarc-USAID, 2013). On the other hand, the affectation of coral reefs due to increased temperatures reported in areas of the Western Pacific of Panama has been documented through biodiversity monitoring programs.</p>



<p>Coastal zone management is carried out by applying gender-responsive integrated coastal management policies and standards, in order to improve the quality of life of communities that depend on coastal resources through the management of coastal and sea spaces, as well as through of resource management actions. Among the instruments used for coastal management, the existence of five special coastal-marine resource management zones and at least forty-six marine protected areas stand out, which have been established and managed regardless of climatic considerations.</p>


<p>In Panama, isolated initiatives have been implemented to incorporate climate into coastal management, among which the following stand out: i) the Project for the protection of carbon stocks in mangroves and protected areas3; ii) the initiative “Blue Economy (BE): Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem Plus (CLME +)”: Promoting national priorities of the blue economy through marine spatial planning in CLME + 4; iii) the National Action Plan for Marine Litter5; iv) Participatory Diagnosis on the effects on the Garachiné community's livelihoods associated with coastal erosion and preparation of a Community Strategy and Action Plan6; v) Participatory Diagnosis on the effects on the livelihoods of the Garachiné community associated with coastal erosion and preparation of a Community Strategy and Action Plan7. While these are ambitious initiatives, a general coastal climate resilience framework is needed to facilitate coherence and complementarity between present and future initiatives. Additionally, they face other limitations related to a low level of involvement of coastal communities, land tenure problems in the coastal strip, as well as insufficient geospatial data and a sustained increase in anthropogenic pressures on fragile coastal marine ecosystems, especially mangroves and peatlands.</p>

<p>The loss of coverage of wetland ecosystems, mainly mangroves, increases the levels of vulnerability of the coastal zone. In 2018, the National Wetlands Policy was approved through Decree 127 of 2018 aimed at avoiding new losses and applying restoration measures, including among its action guidelines promoting the generation of opportunities and strengthening the capacities of community-based organizations to take advantage of business opportunities and other economic alternatives offered by the sustainable use of wetlands with gender equity.</p>
<p>The National Action Plan for Sustainable Fishing recognizes the fundamental role that women have in the fishing sector, as fisherwomen, workers in processing plants, traders, preparers of inputs for fishing, activists and representatives of fishing groups / communities. In addition, national data show that the livelihoods of women who depend on marine-coastal resources will suffer disproportionate impacts caused by the degradation of the oceans, loss of marine biodiversity and natural resources. For these reasons, it is essential that the regulations and strategies related to the regulation of marine-coastal systems and their sustainable use are gender responsive,</p>

<h5>4.4.2 Commitment</h5>




<p>The sectoral commitment consists of strengthening management through two climate tools and integration of blue carbon in the national inventory applying the standards of the 2013 supplement to the 2006 IPCC guidelines, including:</p>

<h5>4.4.3 Operational aspects:</h5>

<p>For the development of the technical guide, the national adaptation planning process will be supported with preparatory resources from the Green Climate Fund. Likewise, there are enabling conditions given the existence of initiatives under implementation, such as ongoing projects on blue economy, seagrass, reef monitoring, national action plan for marine litter, history of carbon measurement in mangroves and restoration projects of Coastal wetlands running. The guide will focus on the restoration of key areas and biological corridors to strengthen connectivity, as well as the design and implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS).</p>
<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration: Interventions around wetlands, especially mangroves, are highly cost efficient since they allow the generation of benefits and impacts in terms of biodiversity, climate mitigation through the management of carbon stocks and strengthening of resilience and livelihoods. of urban and rural communities.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Increased resilience of coastal communities, ecosystems and productive systems to climate change; and avoided emissions plus the absorption potential of blue carbon sinks estimated in the country for correct decision-making that enhances climate action.</em></p>

<h4>4.5 Biodiversity</h4>

<p>Biodiversity refers to the variability of living organisms from any source, including, among others, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, found within each species, between species and between ecosystems.</p>






<h5>4.5.1 National circumstances</h5>




<p>The richness of Panama's biodiversity is extensively documented, with significant figures in contrast to the size of the territory. The National Biodiversity Strategy 2018-2050 highlights that, in part, due to its location as a biogeographic bridge between the flora and fauna of Central and South America, Panama is home to approximately 3.4% of the species of amphibians of the world, 2.3% of its reptile species, 9% of known bird species, and 4.8% of mammal species. In Panama, a total of 220 species of freshwater fish and 1,157 species of marine fish have been identified. It is also among the top 25 countries in the world in terms of diversity of flowering plant species. There are 10,444 plant species known in the territory (3.3% of the world's diversity). Of this, 9,520 are vascular, of which 17 are gymnosperm species and 938 species of ferns and allies; Of the 924 non-vascular, 796 are species of mosses and nearby groups (MiAMBIENTE, 2018a).</p>

<p>
  Climate change is one of the top five pressures driving the loss of biodiversity in the world, along with habitat loss, overexploitation, pollution, and invasive alien species. Panama is developing initiatives to conserve ecosystems, habitats and natural landscapes in situ, with a focus on restoring protected areas and biological corridors to guarantee interconnectivity.</p>

  <p>As for evidence on the level of affectation and vulnerability of biodiversity associated with climate change and variability, there are partial data. For example, there is historical data on the impact of reef ecosystems as a result of monitoring programs mainly in the Western Pacific of Panama, but there is no similar information for the rest of the country or in relation to other ecosystems. The ecosystem-based adaptation approach has been applied in specific pilot-type projects, such as the project for the protection of carbon stocks in mangroves and protected areas in Panama.</p>

<p>The National Biodiversity Strategy and Plan 2018-2050 highlights the different perspective that men and women can have on biodiversity, its intrinsic value from the environmental point of view and its social value, as an element that contributes to human life. It is also recognized that the actions of conservation, sustainable use and restoration of diversity can be a dynamic element in local rural communities in the country, particularly benefiting young people and women.</p>

<p>Compliance with international commitments on biodiversity acquired under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 (known as the Aichi Targets) and the process for the new framework Biodiversity Global Framework towards the 2050 Vision of “Living in Harmony with Nature”, among other global frameworks, is carried out in Panama in the context of a broad strategic policy framework for the management of biodiversity given by the following main instruments:</p>



<ul>
<li>
Strategic Plan of the National System of Protected Areas of Panama (SINAP) - 2017
</li>
<li>
Strategy and National Biodiversity Plan 2018-2050, made official by Executive Decree 128 of 2018
</li>
<li>
Tourism-Conservation-Research Strategy (TCI) officialized by Executive Decree 598 of 2020, aligned with the Master Plan for Sustainable Tourism 2020-2025 (PMTS), whose main objective is to guide the relaunch of the country as a tourist destination after the post reopening pandemic

<p>The commitment will be supported by the national adaptation planning process with preparatory resources from the Green Climate Fund, in alignment with biodiversity strategies and their related instruments, as well as through the National Gender Action Plan that aims to achieve participation and empowerment of Panamanian women in the management and conservation objectives of natural resources. The Climate Change Guide for the Biodiversity Sector will include recognition of contributions and knowledge differentiated by gender to promote opportunities and solutions based on nature that involve and value men and women as agents of conservation.</p>
<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration derived from the commitment: The implementation of the provisions established in the guide on protection of biological diversity and reduction of fires and adaptation measures based on ecosystems, will result in conserved and enriched carbon sinks, as well as reduction of emissions from fires and potrerization.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Biodiversity conservation plan and strategy implemented, habitat vulnerability and fragmentation decreased and resilience increased to extreme climate change events, while protecting carbon pools.</em></p>


<h4>4.6 Sustainable agriculture, livestock and aquaculture</h4>

<p>In the global context in which the demand and production of food is increasing rapidly, Panama is committed to a growth of its agricultural and livestock sector addressing the context of having finite resources, the contribution to livelihoods and food security to long-term, as well as responses to climate change.</p>
<p>One of the country's ambitions is to transform and make the agricultural sector more productive and sustainable through the development and implementation of new strategies for adaptation and mitigation to climate change.</p>

<h5>4.6.1 Sectoral circumstances</h5>

<p>The country's agricultural sector, framed in an economy characterized by being mainly a provider of services, has been losing importance in recent decades, decreasing from 25% in relation to GDP in 1950 to just 2.1% in 2015 and representing a contribution to the country's economy in that year of approximately USD 1,084.1 million (Chacón et al, 2019).</p>
<p>It has been and is the main sector that generates employment opportunities for a significant number of population settled in the provinces of the interior of the country and in the indigenous regions that account for approximately 33% (around 1.3 million people) of the total population. national. According to official data, it is estimated that 39.8% of this rural population is living in conditions of poverty and that in general, 15.7% of the population of Panama works in the agricultural sector, hence its importance. (Chacón et al, 2019).</p>
<p>The gradual transition of the Republic of Panama towards climate-resilient agriculture and livestock is evidenced, among others, through recent sectoral legal instruments such as Law No. 20 of 2018, which adopted measures to support agricultural producers affected by weather conditions. adverse events and the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Program formalized in 2019 that identifies the general rules by which the Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario will grant credits with concessional conditions (terms of up to 25 years and interest rate of 1%) for the development of projects to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.</p>



<p><em>National planning process for the preparation of the commitment.</em></p>
<p>In the process of preparing this update of the CRC1, and given that the Government of Panama is highly committed to eradicating poverty and guaranteeing the population's food and nutritional security, as well as addressing global environmental challenges, it is aware of that climate change adds an additional challenge to the food system.</p>
<p>In this context, the country decides to increase the ambition of the CDN1 presented in 2016, actively linking the Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA), as the governing and normalizing institution of the Panamanian agricultural sector, to the country's climate commitments.</p>
<p>MIDA directs the planning of adaptation and mitigation to climate change in the sector, in line with the institutional frameworks for climate action in the country, seeking to promote the modernization of a productive sector that is low in emissions, which improves the sinks of greenhouse gases, which are more biodiverse. and resilient to new climatic conditions and providing broad socio-economic benefits through climate-smart management.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the sector must have an impact on the generation of income for a significant section of the Panamanian population, and it is expected that, through the inclusive public policy planning process, rural women will particularly benefit from taking an active part from the planning phases to execution phases.</p>
<p>The National Climate Change Plan for the Agricultural Sector (PNCCSA), as an essential public planning tool for the sector, must consider the new climate challenges facing the country and therefore, its updating and operationalization with the In order to increase competitiveness and improve the rural environment in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>In this framework and in order to promote a participatory and representative process, the first Inter-Institutional Committee on Climate Change in the Agricultural Sector (CICCSA) is formed in 2020, which brings together a varied number of national and international key actors so that, Among other objectives, the modernization of the PNCCSA is inclusive and transversal.</p>
<p>As has been indicated, the adaptation and resilience of the sector to new climatic conditions is key and that is why MIDA prioritizes in its actions the implementation of an agroclimatic information system in order to guide, plan and promote the necessary adjustments in the development of agricultural activities based on short-term climate predictions.</p>
<p>Likewise, committed to reducing the GHG contribution of the sector to national emissions, and under the vision by 2050 of achieving carbon neutrality, the country is highly committed to mitigating its GHG emissions, and MIDA wishes to transform the agricultural sector into through the promotion of public policies that allow producers to increase their production without increasing the agricultural frontier, and a profitable and sustainable agriculture model, with access to national and international markets.</p>
<p>That is why MIDA wishes to lead an ambitious transformation of degraded lands to: i) silvopastoral systems, as a feasible solution for traditional livestock farming with a new approach to sustainability and as a viable option for the conservation of natural resources and adaptation to climate change; and ii) agroforestry systems, providing a unique opportunity to increase carbon stocks, use fewer fertilizers and generate co-benefits such as improved soil structure resulting in higher and better productive yields.</p>
<p>And, finally, through Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA), the country wants to add one more effort to the global climate response from the agricultural sector, managing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in several key areas, such as rice and livestock.</p>

<h5> 4.6.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>It should be noted that all this increased ambition that the country demonstrates through the multiple commitments that it intends to develop in the coming years, must run in parallel with the mobilization of financial and technical resources that safeguard the success of each of the initiatives. that are planned to be launched.</p>
<p>That is why the commitments demonstrated in favor of mitigating and adapting a strategic sector as relevant as agriculture, require international support for its implementation.</p>


<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration: Reduced GHG emissions in agricultural systems as a result of the application of good climatic practices in agricultural and livestock farms, with the potential to generate green jobs and increase the resilience of agricultural producers to hydrometeorological events.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Strengthen and transform the agricultural sector so that it is more productive and sustainable through the development and implementation of new strategies for adaptation and mitigation to climate change.</em></p>

<h4>4.7 Resilient human settlements</h4>

<p>This strategic area refers to public policy and management actions aimed at sustainable and resilient development in urban and territorial areas, improving the quality of life of the inhabitants. It includes matters related to urban and territorial planning and housing, and its relationship with patterns of production, distribution and consumption of goods and services such as education, health, employment, infrastructure, transportation, among others.</p>

<h5>4.7.1 Sectoral circumstances</h5>

<p>In Panama about 65% of the population lives in urban and semi-urban areas. Urban development has exacerbated climatic and social vulnerabilities, including inefficient infrastructure construction and reconstruction processes by not incorporating the climatic variable. The accelerated growth experienced by the main urban areas of the country, led to disorderly growth and the proliferation of informal settlements. Although Panama City has a Resilience Strategy presented in 2018 in the context of the 100 Resilient Cities Program, the management of resilient cities is incipient and has not permeated the processes of urbanization and land use planning. In rural areas, climate vulnerability is superlative associated with the risk of disasters affecting already impoverished livelihoods and closely dependent on meteorological conditions and climate variability. The result is a panorama of recurring losses and damages due to variability and climate change in human settlements.</p>

<p>The inclusion of vulnerability aspects in the sectoral regulations began in 2011 when the bases for a complementarity of functions between the housing and land use areas began to be established to include variables of risk, vulnerability and sustainability in planning, studies, plans, programs, projects, decision making and / or approvals. In 2018 through Executive Decree 39 of 2018 that approves the review and update of the Urban Development Plan of the Metropolitan Areas of the Pacific and Atlantic, attached to the Ministry of Housing and Territorial Planning, and its general regulations, which include among its goals :</p>

<ul>
<li>Support the conservation, protection, restoration and sustainable use of physical (water, soil, air) and biological (flora, fauna, ecosystem) resources of the metropolitan region;</li>
<li>Migrate towards a sustainable development, compact of zones or concentrated nodes, in front of the fragmented and dispersed development that prevails in the metropolitan areas;</li>
<li>Avoid at all costs occupations in vulnerable areas prone to risk floods, landslides and projecting ourselves to climate change.
</li></ul>

<h5>4.7.2 Commitment</h5>

<p>The commitment involves the development of a technical instrument of national scope, as well as the involvement of local authorities in mitigation actions by managing their carbon footprint.</p>

<h5>4.7.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>The development of the technical guide will be supported through the national adaptation planning process financed with preparatory resources from the Green Climate Fund, in alignment with tools such as vulnerability maps and critical areas and the updating of planning instruments such as the National Plan for Climate Change. Disaster Risk Management and the Urban Development Plan for the Metropolitan Areas of the Pacific (Panama) and the Atlantic (Colón), which establishes comprehensive and participatory development plans to face urban growth by the year 2035. The municipalities that participate in the Pact Global of Mayors for Climate and Energy will have strengthened capacities to advance in the implementation of the guide and the Reduce Your Municipal Footprint Program.</p>

<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration: By integrating climate change into planning and land use planning instruments, it contributes to reducing GHG emissions and increasing the resilience of cities.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Adaptive capacity of communities to the adverse effects of climate change increased, reduced vulnerability and measures to manage disaster risk established.</em></p>

<h4>4.8 Public health</h4>

<p>Climate change influences the social and environmental determinants of health, such as clean air, clean water, sufficient food, and safe housing. Many of the deadliest diseases, such as diarrhea, malnutrition, malaria and dengue, are highly sensitive to climate, while increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems that increase environmental health risks through disease transmission .</p>
<p>It should be noted that these diseases have a direct impact on the responsibilities and care burdens, especially of women and girls, as has been evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Disparities in access to a good quality structure, leaves women in an evident condition of vulnerability; In this sense, it should be highlighted how infrastructure services are a determining component of social inclusion, poverty reduction and promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. The design of a sustainable infrastructure that takes into account the different needs and preferences of men and women leads to a more inclusive development,</p>

<h5>4.8.1 Sectorial circumstances</h5>

<p>The areas of the country with poor sanitation infrastructure are the areas where the poorest and most vulnerable people live. The very vulnerability of the infrastructure of health facilities limits their ability to continue operating during and after disasters and / or emergencies, which increases the vulnerability of populations, in a vicious circle. In Panama, sufficient technical capacity is required to build resilience in the health system and at all levels; as well as for planning, preparing and responding to emergencies and / or disasters and gender responsive adaptation to climate change. A key line of action to advance in this process is for the health sector to be duly represented in the national adaptation planning process, with the construction of specific health chapters. (Thompson, 2019)</p>
<p>Panama has maintained a systematic progress in the matter of substances that deplete the ozone layer (ODS) and implementation of the Montreal Protocol. Since 2004, formal work has been done on the establishment of mechanisms for the regulation and control of ODS imports and in 2018, with the ratification of the Kigali Amendment, the foundations are laid for the establishment of a regulatory framework for importation and consumption. of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These gases were implemented to replace ODS and have a global warming potential that can be up to 1000 times greater than carbon dioxide, although they do not threaten the ozone layer; so replacing them will help meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>In terms of sectoral strategic frameworks, it is highlighted that the National Climate Change Strategy 2050 incorporates basic health actions in terms of access to drinking water, while prioritizing the Sanitation Project of the City - Bay of Panama. The National Health Policy and Strategic Guidelines 2016-2025 is guided by principles and values ​​through which it seeks to achieve a better level of well-being and quality of life of the population throughout the life course, integrating individuals, the family , the environment and the community. The policy has strategic guidelines that include among its lines of action that health interventions should be aimed at improving universal access to health and universal health coverage in order to reduce gaps and inequalities,</p>

<h5>4.8.2 Commitment</h5>

<p>The main commitment in matters of health and climate change is to expand planning instruments to reduce the vulnerability of the population through the development of the Climate Change Plan for the Health Sector, focusing on strengthening epidemiological surveillance systems with environmental risks and climate risks.</p>

<h5>4.8.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>The commitment will be supported by the national adaptation planning process financed with preparatory resources from the Green Climate Fund, in alignment with the implementation of the National Health Policy and Strategic Guidelines 2016-2025 that integrates climate change. In this sense, the use of the experiences derived from the realization of bioclimatic reports of the prognosis of the Aedes aegypti infestation index for the districts of Panama and San Miguelito and of the advances in terms of safe hospitals and urban risk advanced by the Ministry of Health with support from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).</p>
<p>Potential for sectoral adaptation-mitigation integration in the medium term: By integrating climate change in the development of health policies and plans, it will be possible to influence the resilience and reduction of emissions in the sector through the construction of safe health facilities. in the face of disaster risk and the reduction of carbon and water footprint in health infrastructure through the Reduce Your Corporate Footprint program (applied to public, private and civil society organizations), while reducing the vulnerability of the population to climate-related diseases.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Increased human health resilience through strengthened health surveillance systems and guaranteed care in health services for vulnerable populations.</em></p>

<h4>4.9 Sustainable infrastructure</h4>

<p>This strategic area refers to the need to design infrastructure that adjusts to local contexts, provides efficient services, and is durable, addressing environmental risks and sustainability, by ensuring financial resources to build and maintain the infrastructure during its useful life. , consider the preferences and needs of the population, and understand the political and institutional dynamics to ensure that projects survive political cycles (IDB, Sustainable Cities).</p>

<h5>4.9.1 Sectorial circumstances</h5>

<p>In recent years, construction activity in Panama has been oriented mainly to residential homes, offices, commercial premises and tourist infrastructure. The importance of this sector in economic dynamics lies in the multiplier effect it exerts on the demand for goods and services from other sectors of the economy and in its great capacity to employ unskilled labor. However, the construction model of the country has been based on a traditional vision of gray engineering that has resulted in an accelerated urbanization process not planned environmentally or climatic, with important territorial asymmetries.</p>


<p>In addition, the construction standards applied show limited knowledge of the risk and vulnerability to climate change by the governing entities in the development of public infrastructure and private developers. There are tools to promote the sustainability of infrastructures at the urban level and there are initiatives to apply voluntary eco-efficiency standards that are mainly aimed at energy efficiency. These initiatives still need to be scaled for greater application and reach at the national level.</p>
<p>Making the nexus between natural and built infrastructure visible is a key aspect in moving towards a sustainable infrastructure model. The loss of ecosystem protection services due to the impact on coastal wetland ecosystems increases the vulnerability of the coastal zone, while the increased risk of disaster due to land use conversion and poor construction practices affects both the urban area as rural of the country. The cyclical dynamics of loss of public road infrastructure, as well as housing and livelihoods due to floods and extreme weather events is evidence of the need to transform construction models and practices to incorporate disaster risk and climate variables.</p>

<h5>4.9.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>The Climate Change Plan for the infrastructure sector will focus on the development of resilient infrastructures in the face of climate change impacts, considering technologies such as drip irrigation, hydraulics for flood control, sustainable buildings, among others. Through the approach of increasing the resilience of infrastructures, the Plan will include the development of a vulnerability index, socioeconomic studies, climate change scenarios and climate risk assessment. Based on this baseline, adequate planning of adaptation measures to be implemented in the sector can be carried out.</p>
<p>The commitment will be supported by the national adaptation planning process financed with preparatory resources from the Green Climate Fund, as well as through a joint MiAMBIENTE-MEF training program for public servants on the incorporation of climate change for structuring of projects. Likewise, the commitment is facilitated by the implementation of the Energy Transition Agenda and the current legal framework related to sustainable buildings, which includes: i) the sustainable building regulations for the Republic of Panama approved by Resolution No. JTIA 035 of 06.26. .19 of the Technical Board of Engineering and Architecture;</p>
<p>The technical guideline on climate change for public investment in infrastructure projects, to assess current and future risks related to climate change and incorporate adaptation measures throughout the project cycles prepared by MiAMBIENTE in May 2020 and The beginning of the review process of the environmental management instruments including the legal framework of the Environmental Impact Assessment process started in December 2020 are also means of implementation that will facilitate the fulfillment of the commitment.</p>
<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration: The widespread application of sustainability standards in construction that will derive from the implementation of both instruments, will have an impact on reducing the carbon footprint by increasing energy efficiency, at the same time as the infrastructure will be more resilient to climate change impacts.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Infrastructure resilient to climate change designed and built with sustainable criteria, in urban and rural areas.</em></p>

<h4>4.10 Circular Economy</h4>

<p>The circular economy proposes a new social economic model through which resources, material flows, energy and waste are used and optimized. The transition to a circular economy implies acting transversally at all levels and sectors of the national economy, influencing lifestyles and individual consumption patterns, up to the transformation of industrial processes and the incorporation of sustainability into development agendas. local, at the level of municipalities and other instances of local development.</p>

<h5>4.10.1 Sectorial circumstances</h5>

<p>In general terms, Panama continues to work on the basis of a linear economy that, although it generates profits and jobs for the country in its position as a logistics and multimodal transportation center, demands more and more resources (water, energy and food), through while generating more organic and inorganic waste and less capacity for ecosystems to regenerate over time. Waste management in the country is still incipient, lacking both knowledge and investment resources to stimulate the required sector transformation.</p>
<p>The experience accumulated in both the public and private sectors in implementing cleaner production initiatives since 2007 has been key to advancing the recent development of an enabling legal framework to stimulate the transformation agenda towards a Circular Economy that includes the following regulations :</p>

<ul>
<li>Law 33 of 2018 establishes the zero waste policy and its framework of action for the integral management of waste and mandates the sectoral entities to promote the import, manufacture and commercialization of products that favor the integral management of waste, as well as regulate the import of materials or products whose valorization or integral management is limited or non-existent in the country;</li>
<li>Law 1 of 19 of 2018 that prohibits the use of single-use polyethylene bags in retail establishments, expanding the restriction for warehouses and wholesalers;</li>
<li>Law of February 6, 2018 that establishes the integrated management of solid waste in public institutions.</li>
<li>Municipal Agreement 124 of 2015 of the Municipal Council of Panama through which the Municipal Policy for Comprehensive Solid Waste Management and Zero Waste Program 2015-2035 of Panama City is adopted.</li>
</ul>

<p>In October 2019, an Agreement was signed between the MiAMBIENTE, the Industrial Union of Panama (SIP) and the National Council of Private Enterprise (CONEP) for the creation of the Circular Economy Center of Panama.</p>
<p>Waste management actions also have repercussions on gender equality, considering that initiatives by women's groups focused on the reuse and recycling of materials for the production and sale of various products have been documented in the sector. Improving the situation of the sector presents the opportunity to improve the situation of women, many of whom are involved in waste management informally. Actions to promote a circular economy through the integral management of waste and solid waste in a sustainable way has the potential to promote sources of decent employment that promote gender equality and economic empowerment of women.</p>


<h5>4.10.2 Commitment</h5>

<p>In this commitment of a transversal nature to the entire economy, the key role of the involvement of the private sector stands out.</p>

<h5>4.10.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>A key milestone that enables this contribution in the area of ​​Circular Economy is the officialization of Executive Decree 100 of October 20, 2020 that establishes the National Program for the management of GHG Emissions, operationalized through the Reduce Your Corporate Footprint and Reduce Your Footprint Programs Municipal, as well as the process of updating the legal framework on the certification of environmentally clean products and services established in Executive Decree 100 of 2008, included in the project to modernize environmental management instruments based on the conceptual framework of climate change and Climate variability analysis in execution since November 2020 with cooperation resources from the CAF.</p>
<p>Potential for adaptation-mitigation integration: The implementation of circular economy practices will promote efficiency in the use of resources, reducing the carbon footprint, the water footprint and favoring healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p><em>Ambition: Transition of Panamanian society in the public and private sector aligned to a circular economy model.</em></p>

<h3>COMMITMENTS ON STRENGTHENING CAPACITIES FOR ACTION AND CLIMATE TRANSPARENCY</h3>


<p>Given that the climate agenda is a transversal development agenda, in addition to the sectoral commitments, Panama identified two priority areas for the promotion and consolidation of climate action at the national and sub-national level related to the management of information of climate relevance, namely :</p>

<ul>
<li>The loss and damage agenda directly associated with climate vulnerability

</li><li>The tools for monitoring and evaluating climate policies, which do not only imply environmental indicators, but the need to identify relevant economic and social indicators</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.1 Monitoring and Evaluation (ME) of Loss and Damage</h4>

<p>In November 2013, the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage was established at COP 19 to address loss and damage related to the impacts of climate change, including extreme events and events. gradual, in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. In this subject, a key aspect is to analyze the availability of public and international financing for losses and damages of developing countries to face climate impacts.</p>

<h5>5.1.1 National circumstances</h5>

<p>Due to its location on the Central American Isthmus, Panama has a high exposure to the occurrence of weather-related disasters. With respect to climate variability, during the period 1990 to 2013, in the Republic of Panama a total of 2,717 events of natural origin were registered; Of these, 57% correspond to floods, 17% to gales or strong winds, 15% to landslides, while the remaining 11% are distributed in other events, being floods the ones that have caused the greatest number of people affected and deaths in the study period (MIAMBIENTE, 2018).</p>

<h5>5.1.2 Commitment</h5>

<p>To advance in the determination of damages and losses, Panama undertakes to strengthen its capacities for the determination of damages and losses as follows:</p>

</tbody></table>

<h5>5.1.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>Panama recently has the System for the Collection and Evaluation of Damages (SIRED) platform, with the objective of collecting data on natural disasters that fall into the category of extreme climatic events such as landslides and floods. Based on this, it seeks to expand the SIRED platform, to include those slow-process events such as desertification and degradation of lands and forests, loss of biodiversity, salinization, sea level rise, ocean acidification.</p>

<h4>5.2 Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) for Climate Risk Management and Low Emission Development</h4>

<p>The climate agenda is a cross-cutting development agenda. In this sense, the monitoring and evaluation of climate policies does not only imply environmental indicators, but it is necessary to identify relevant economic and social indicators. While the measurement of progress in mitigation is generally more developed, the measurement of adaptation is a complex subject and less developed from a theoretical and practical point of view. Even so, both issues require attention in the design of monitoring and evaluation systems, being an additional challenge, but necessary, to carry out a joint evaluation of mitigation and adaptation (Memories, 2018).</p>

<h5>5.2.1 National circumstances</h5>

<p>The initial challenge corresponds to the initial identification and structuring of the adaptation and mitigation monitoring, reporting and verification system, seeking articulation and synergies between the country's development plan, the sectoral plans, the sustainable development objectives and the commitments established in this Updated CDN1. Following the provisions of the Reinforced Transparency Framework, and in the context of the implementation of the National Platform for Climate Transparency (PNTC), the MRV system of Panama will generate information on the progress in the implementation of the CRC, as well as as information on the support in the form of financing, technology transfer and capacity building required and received, in accordance with the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>National inventory report (mandatory)</li>
<li>Information to monitor progress in the implementation of the CRC (mandatory)</li>
<li>Information on the impacts of climate change and adaptation (desirable)</li>
<li>Information about the support provided (recommended)</li>
<li>Information about the support needed and receiving (voluntary)</li>
</ul>


<h5>5.2.2 Commitment</h5>
<p>To meet this challenge, Panama has made the following capacity building commitment:</p>

</tbody></table>



<h5>5.2.3 Operational aspects</h5>

<p>The fulfillment of this commitment is supported by the initiative to strengthen capacity for transparency (CBIT) in implementation since 2019 with resources from the Environmental Fund for the Environment (GEF) with the United Nations Environment Program to the Environment (UN Environment) as the Implementing Agency and Wetlands International as the Executing Entity. Through this project, the National Platform for Climate Transparency (PNTC) will be launched, which will host:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Greenhouse Gas Inventories System</li>
<li>National Registry for Mitigation Actions</li>
<li>National System for Monitoring and Evaluation of Adaptation</li>
<li>National Registry for Means of Implementation for Climate Action, including financial support, technical assistance and capacity building received.</li>

</ul>



<h3>GAPS, NEEDS AND CHALLENGES FOR CLIMATE ACTION</h3>


<p>The implementation of the Updated CDN1 poses challenges in terms of financing, technical, technological, scientific capacities, institutional transformation and governance. Although there are initiatives and alliances in the country between different public sector institutions and non-governmental organizations, there are still gaps in capacity and resources that must be managed.</p>
<p>In order to identify the main limitations and / or needs for the implementation of the sectoral commitments acquired, the Ministry of the Environment carried out rounds of consultations among the key stakeholders. As a result, the following three main categories of needs were established:</p>

<ul>
<li>Technology transfer</li>
<li>Capacity building</li>
<li>Financing needs</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a summary description of the main findings. Detailed and expanded information is available in the Second Biennial Update Report (2IBA) of Panama, chapter 4.</p>


<h4>6.1 Technology transfer needs.</h4>

<p>In terms of technology, a greater number of needs were identified in the sectors of “Integrated River Basin Management” (25%) and “Forests (LULUCF)” (20%). The category of "Others" also reflects a high number of needs (15%), indicating limitations in administrative and investigative issues. Although it is not a conclusive analysis of the national priority needs in the technological context at the national level, it identifies the needs expressed by the technical teams of the Climate Change Directorate, responsible for coordinating climate action and those who manage projects with climate components.</p>
<p><img src="./PAN-TR_files/PAN-NDC1_5.png"></p>
<p>* The IPPU and Waste sectors have not been included among the sectors of the updated CDN1 of Panama, but are part of the National Inventories, by which they are reflected in the needs analysis.</p>

<p>In the Technological Needs Assessment Report for Climate Change (ENT) issued by MiAMBIENTE in 2017, a list of 24 technologies was identified to address the problem of drinking water and sanitation, particularly for the Arco Seco area, including among others: a) preparation of water balances in priority basins as a contribution to the GICH; b) evaluation of the impact of saline intrusion in coastal aquifers and the delimitation of areas vulnerable to contamination by salinization; c) identification and planning of actions to control floods in the event of floods due to heavy rain events for their use; d) establishment of an environmental quality index for its application in rivers, reservoirs and wetlands; e) development of the technical manual to carry out projects for artificial recharge of aquifers (methodology and procedures). The next steps in the technology needs assessment process involve identifying and analyzing the opportunities and barriers for each of the identified technologies.</p>

<h4>6.2 Capacity-building needs</h4>

<p>In terms of capacity building, the sectors with the greatest number of needs are the Integrated Watershed Management sector (28%), Forests (LULUCF) (16%) and Agriculture, Livestock and Aquaculture (12%).</p>


<p><img src="./PAN-TR_files/PAN-NDC1_6.png"></p>
  <p>* The IPPU and Waste sectors have not been included among the sectors of the updated CDN1 of Panama, but are part of the National Inventories, by which they are reflected in the needs analysis.</p>




<h4>6.3 Financing needs</h4>

<p>Regarding financing needs, once again the "Integrated Watershed Management" sector is the one with the highest amount (30%), followed by "Forests (LULUCF)" (20%). The classification “Others” (15%) contains general needs for both administrative and research climate action.</p>


<p><img src="./PAN-TR_files/PAN-NDC1_7.png"></p>
<p>* The IPPU and Waste sectors have not been included among the sectors of the updated CDN1 of Panama, but they are part of the National Inventories, by which they are reflected in the needs analysis.</p>


<h4>6.4 Support received regarding means of implementation</h4>

<p>Regarding the support received, a general analysis was carried out by scope of climate action in mitigation and adaptation, maintaining a category of transversal support. The greatest amount of support received was in the area of ​​Adaptation, with 72% l, as reflected in the following graph.</p>


<p><img src="./PAN-TR_files/PAN-NDC1_8.png"></p>

<p>The graph reflects the percentage based on the number of initiatives reported as support, its percentage is not based on the total amount received, since there was not complete information for the case of some initiatives.</p>



<h3>INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO SUPPORT CLIMATE ACTION</h3>



<h4>GAPS, NEEDS AND CHALLENGES FOR CLIMATE ACTION</h4>

<p>To advance in the fulfillment of the climatic commitments acquired and considering the categories of needs listed above, in addition to inter-institutional coordination between institutions and local entities, a strategic use of international cooperation is required.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Environment (MiAMBIENTE) as the national focal point for climate finance facilities, together with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINRE) are the main responsible for this strategic climate alignment process for mobilization of global and regional resources.</p>
<p>The Republic of Panama actively participates in cooperative initiatives to advance climate action, ranging from instances to influence the international climate negotiation process, to thematic programs and access to climate financing windows. Some of these international spaces for climate action in which Panama participates at the time of the CDN1 update are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Programa EUROCLIMA+</li>
<li>Coalition of Nations with Tropical Forests</li>
<li>NDC Partnership</li>
<li>Partnership for Market Readiness</li>
<li>Association of Greenhouse Gas Programs of Latin America and the Caribbean</li>
<li>Ibero-American Network of Climate Change Offices</li>


<li>Latin American Network of National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</li>


<li>Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean</li>


<li>Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.</li>


<li>Pacific Rim Ocean-Climate Action Partnership</li>
</ul>


<p>Likewise, the Republic of Panama maintains collaborative work with agencies of the United Nations system such as UNDP, UN Environment, FAO, and international and multilateral financial institutions such as IDB, CABEI, World Bank, CAF, to access sources of climate finance, including the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), among others.</p>
<p>Even with these cooperation supports, the challenges for a coherent implementation of this Updated CRC1 are multiple, including without being restricted to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prioritization of the climate dimension in the post-2020 economic reactivation</li>


<li>Climate finance strategy as part of foreign policy, fiscal policy and public credit</li>
<li>Strengthening of climate negotiation and relationship capacities at all levels</li>


<li>Operationalization of inter- and intra-institutional implementation mechanisms and arrangements for budget planning and execution in a climate-sensitive manner</li>
<li>Structuring transformational climate programs successfully presented to global and regional financial institutions to increase available financial and knowledge resources</li>
<li>Overcome the perception that the climate issue is the sole or priority responsibility of the environmental authority, clarifying the roles and responsibility of each of the actors and sectors in the framework of climate policy and action.</li>
<li>Unlock private climate investment, reducing dependence on public financing</li>
<li>Use the information generated by the monitoring and evaluation system for decision-making beyond the Ministry of the Environment and the purely public sphere</li>
</ul>

<p>The synergy, coherence and complementarity between the sources and processes of climate finance will be the guiding principle of the relationship with cooperation agencies and development banks and the private sector. In light of the provisions of the Enhanced Transparency Framework (MTR) of the Paris Agreement, the achievement of coherence and complementarity between the different financing opportunities will be facilitated through the implementation of the National Platform for Climate Transparency (PNTC) previously described.</p>


<p>In operational terms, the kick-off of the Updated CDN1 deployment will be directly supported by a set of means and deployment arrangements that includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>National Adaptation Planning Process (NAP) that Panama will carry out with the support of the preparatory program of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), with the United Nations Environment Program (UN Environment) as implementing partner</li>
<li>Preparation of the National Climate Action Plan (PNAC) with the support of the World Bank with emphasis on the investment plan for the implementation of the CDN1 Updated</li>
<li>Process of implementation, monitoring and updating of the CRC led by the MiAMBIENTE with the intervention of the National Committee on Climate Change of Panama (CONACCP), as has been regulated through the provisions of Chapter II on the CRC of Executive Decree 100 of 2020 that regulates the mitigation of climate change and establishes other provisions.</li>
<li>Collaborative agreement with private sector unions to promote the circular economy and sustainable finance</li>
<li>Article 12 of the Paris Agreement recognizes that improving climate change education, as well as training, awareness and participation, are key elements to improve global action on climate change, as they promote changes in lifestyles , attitudes and behaviors that promote low-emission, resilient and sustainable development.</li>
<li>The Action for Climate Empowerment (known as ACE for its acronym in English) is a transversal proposal in public policies that seeks to generate and articulate capacities that promote transformative action against climate change, relying on education, training, awareness social, access to information, citizen participation and international cooperation, as essential elements for the implementation of training processes and political and social strengthening on climate competencies. For this, common work between all sectors, areas and institutions and at all scales (from global to local) with citizens is necessary.</li>
<li>The implementation of the Updated CDN1 begins with the implementation in 2021 of capacity building processes for climate action that include:</li>
<li>Joint program between the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) for training in the structuring of public investment projects incorporating the climate dimension. The objective is to establish the bases and standards so that by 2025 all the projects that enter the National Public Investment System (SINIP) duly integrate the climate dimension. In parallel with the support of the CAF, the capacity building of the consultants involved in the preparation of environmental impact studies and environmental audits will be supported, in light of the updated regulations on environmental management instruments based on the conceptual framework of change. climate and climate variability analysis.</li>
<li>Strengthening the capacities of the Panamanian financial sector to create an enabling environment for climate finance, through initiatives for the involvement of the private sector and the design of innovative financial mechanisms, in strategic association with the UNEP FI initiative and the Development Bank Club ( IDFC), taking advantage of resources from the Green Climate Fund preparatory program.</li>
<li>The entry into implementation in 2021 of the Regional Agreement on access to information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, known as the Escazú Agreement, ratified by Panama through the Law N ° 125 of 2020, which is a concrete opportunity to address and mitigate the climate crisis through a rights-based approach, recognizing the nexus between climate change, poverty and inequality. The operationalization of this nexus is the basis of the call for climate action in Panama embodied in the Updated CDN1, to follow the path towards the decarbonization of the Panamanian economy and the model of sustainable, resilient and inclusive development for present and future generations of Panamanians and Panamanians.</li>

<p><strong>Energy Sector</strong></p>
<p>To develop the contribution and obtain its indicators, a BAU scenario and an alternative scenario called the Energy Transition Agenda (ATE) were developed, from which the conditional commitment was derived to the extent of receiving international support for climate action. For the development of scenarios, the Green Economy Model was used. Emissions will be monitored using the results of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the Energy sector.</p>
<p>The details of the alternative scenario on which the new conditional contribution for the energy sector is based are described below:</p>
<p>By 2030 the alternative scenario includes:</p>
<p>-In terms of electric mobility, it includes conservative ENME goals and the evolution of public transport according to PIMUS, MIBUS and METRO. Specifically, vehicles lifted by 10% in private fleets, 25% in private vehicles, 20% in public transport and 30% in official fleets. Includes non-tax incentives.</p>

<p>-In terms of electrical energy, EE evolution is foreseen according to the EE master plan and the UREE Law. Estimated demand Power (MW) 2,301.98; estimated energy demand (GWh) 16,359.81; Access to 100% electricity.</p>

<p>-In terms of public and private infrastructure, it is expected 10% of new road and road works with EERR, EE and bicycle lanes.</p>


<p>By 2050 the alternative scenario includes:</p>


<p>-In terms of electric mobility, it includes conservative ENME goals and the evolution of public transport according to PIMUS, MIBUS and METRO. Specifically, 30% electric vehicles in private fleets, 75% in private vehicles, 60% in public transport and 90% in official fleets. Includes tax incentives.


</p><p>-In terms of energy efficiency, the solar thermal evolution is foreseen according to PNTP. 605 of penetration of efficient equipment and 247,904 m2 solar thermal ACS and industry. Includes incentives.


</p><p>- In terms of electrical energy, EE evolution is foreseen according to the EE Master Plan and the UREE Law. Estimated demand Power (MW) 3,304.95; estimated energy demand (GWh) 33,572.26; Access to 100% electricity.</p>

<h3> ANNEX B. COMMUNICATION IN ADAPTATION</h3>

<p>In accordance with Decision 9 / CMA.1, the Communication on Adaptation of the Republic of Panama is presented below as a component of the first update of the Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN1).</p>

<h4>National circumstances</h4>

<p>This section provides a general description of the country's circumstances, its geographical, climatic, demographic and economic characteristics. For more information, go to section 4 of the updated Panama CDN1, in which the information is developed in accordance with the sectoral commitments, from a comprehensive adaptation-mitigation vision.</p>

<h4>Geography and climate</h4>

<p>The territory of the Republic of Panama comprises the land surface, the territorial sea, the underwater continental shelf and the air space between Colombia and Costa Rica in accordance with the boundary treaties signed between Panama and these two States. Panama is characterized by a very hot tropical climate, which prevails throughout the year on the coasts and lowlands, but which changes inland as it gains altitude (INEC, 2005).</p>

<h4> Water resources</h4>

<p>Panama is considered one of the countries in the world with a great water resource, this water wealth is generated by a hydrographic network made up of 52 basins, which collect the waters of some 500 rivers of two slopes, the Caribbean and the Pacific. This water regime is conditioned by the position, orientation and relief of the Isthmus (INEC, 2005).</p>

<h4>Forest Cover</h4>

<p>In 2019, the Ministry of the Environment through the Directorate of Environmental Information (DIAM) presented a diagnostic map which detailed the state of forests and other wooded lands. According to the report generated, Panama has 65.4% of forests and other wooded lands, 32.5% of other lands and 2.1 of continental waters (MiAMBIENTE, 2019a).</p>
<p>Forests in Panama are of great value thanks to the multiple services and benefits they provide us, however, it is necessary that they be monitored since a lot of pressure is exerted on them due to forestry and agricultural activities.</p>

<h4> Demography</h4>

<p>Estimates of the total population made for the year 2018, establish a figure of 4,158,783 inhabitants, which in relation to the total area of ​​75,517 km2 in Panama, represents a population density of 55.07 inhabitants / km2 (MINSA, 2019a).</p>

<h4>Economic Profile</h4>

<p>Before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and, Panama was among the fastest growing economies in the world, with an annual average of 4.6% in the last five years. The country has made progress in reducing poverty in recent years, partly due to economic growth and public transfers. Between 2015 and 2018, it would result in a decrease in poverty from 15.4% to 12.6%, while extreme poverty declined from 6.7% to 5.2%. Panama is considered one of the most unequal in the region (World Bank, 2020)</p>

<h4>Main institutional arrangements and national regulatory frameworks</h4>

<p>Inter-institutional arrangements consist of a set of formal arrangements (such as regulations, directives, laws, decrees, or memoranda of understanding) aimed at providing the necessary financial resources, data, and human resources.</p>
<p>The legal hierarchy of Climate Change in Panama is detailed below:</p>
<p>Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama The Constitution of the Republic of Panama establishes in its Article 118 that it is a fundamental duty of the State to guarantee that the population lives in a healthy environment free of contamination, which satisfies the requirements of the adequate development of human life. . Article 119 says that the State and all the inhabitants of the national territory have the duty to promote social and economic development that prevents pollution of the environment, maintains ecological balance and avoids the destruction of ecosystems.</p>

<h4>International legal framework on climate change</h4>

<p>Panama has adopted commitments on climate change by ratifying the following laws:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Law No. 10 of April 12, 1995, "by which the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is approved, made in New York on May 9, 1992".</p></li>
<li><p>Law No. 88 of November 30, 1998, "by which the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is approved, made in Kyoto, on December 11, 1997".</p></li>
<li><p>Law No. 40 of September 12, 2016, by which the Paris Agreement is approved, made in Paris on December 12, 2015.</p></li>
<li><p>Executive Decree No. 393 of September 17, 2015, the Republic of Panama adopts the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), within which, in terms of climate change, Goal 13 called Climate Action stands out.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Law 41 of July 1, 1998, General Environment</em></p>
<p>The General Law 41 of the Environment of the Republic of Panama, indicates that the administration of the environment is an obligation of the State, therefore, it establishes the principles and basic norms for the protection, conservation and recovery of the environment, promoting the sustainable use of resources. natural. In addition, it orders environmental management and integrates it with social and economic objectives, in order to achieve the sustainable human development of the country.</p>
<p><em>Sole Text of General Law 41 on the Environment</em></p>
<p>With the enactment of Law 8 of March 25, 2015, which creates the Ministry of the Environment, a new single text is established for the General Law of the Environment, which includes a Title on the issue of climate change.</p>
<p>Title V on Climate Change contains Chapter I, on Adaptation to Climate Change, which states the following:</p>

</ul>

<p>Among the main institutional arrangements for the management of adaptation in Panama we can identify the following.</p>

<h4>National Committee on Climate Change</h4>

<p>Through Resolution No. DM-0221-2018 of June 4, 2018, by which the Internal Regulations of the National Climate Change Committee (CONACCP) are adopted as expressed in its Article 1, and in its Article 2, it says that it will come into force as of its approval by each of the members of CONACCP.</p>
<p>The aims and objectives of the committee according to the Internal Regulations are:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Consolidate the inter-institutional coordination system for compliance with the provisions of international agreements on climate change.</li>
<li>It will serve as a coordinating counterpart for actions with the Inter-Institutional Environmental System (SIA).</li>
<li>Promote the issue of climate change, in a transversal manner, in national policies in each of the institutions that are members of the committee.</li>
</ol>

<p>CONACCP is made up of the following institutions:</p>

<h4>
Interinstitutional Committee on Climate Change for the Agricultural Sector</h4>

<p>The Inter-institutional Committee on Climate Change for the Agricultural Sector (CICCSA) was created by Resolution No. OAL 059-ADM.2019 of Monday, June 10, 2019. “Through which the National Climate Change Plan is adopted and implemented for the Agricultural Sector and the Inter-Institutional Committee on Climate Change for the Agricultural Sector is created ”, published in Official Gazette No. 28864.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agricultural Development is responsible for directing adaptation and mitigation measures to the agricultural sector, through the Agro-Environmental and Climate Change Unit, which is responsible for planning, coordinating and supporting the implementation, disclosure, follow-up, monitoring. and evaluation of compliance with the actions established in the National Climate Change Plan for the Agricultural Sector (PNCCSA) (MIDA, 2018)</p>

<h4> Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities of the country</h4>

<p>As already mentioned, Panama is a highly vulnerable country to the impacts of climate variability and change, although compared to the countries of the Central American and Caribbean region, it is in a privileged condition.</p>
<p>With respect to climate variability, during the period 1990 to 2013, in the Republic of Panama a total of 2,717 events of natural origin were registered; Of these, 57% correspond to floods, 17% to gales or strong winds, 15% to landslides, while the remaining 11% is distributed in other events. It should be noted that, within the mentioned climatic phenomena, floods are the ones that have caused the greatest number of people affected and deaths in the study period.</p>
<p>However, the records or reports of damage have tended to increase and are closely related to the behavior of extreme events registered in neighboring areas in the last decade. The foregoing allows us to infer that, although the population may be better prepared, the effects on infrastructure, communication routes or public services may be susceptible to damage and with collateral impacts for the population.</p>
<p>The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) states that since 1950 many changes have been observed in extreme weather events (IPCC, 2014). Panama is no exception. The changes shown in climate variability in recent years have increased by around 1-2 ° C, which has highlighted a condition of increasing vulnerability in key economic sectors: water resources, agriculture, human health, marine areas- coastal and resilient cities.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of water resources in Panama, the crises resulting from extreme precipitation events that occurred in recent years such as La Purísima 2010, El Niño 2015, and storm Otto 2016, and the most recent impacts from tropical storms ETA and Iota 2020, as well as the rainfall deficits observed during El Niño in 2015, where the levels of water sources at the national level were critical. All these events have highlighted the vulnerability of the systems around the collection, distribution and access to water.</p>
<p>With regard to the marine-coastal areas, it is known that these resources have been seriously threatened by the pressure exerted by human activities and the impacts associated with climate change. Among the most common climate threats in these areas are strong winds, floods, droughts, landslides, earthquakes, rising sea levels, and saline intrusion. Against this background, the vulnerability of coastal settlers and economic sectors is threatened, particularly in the face of changes in climate variability that, year after year, seem to intensify the extreme values ​​of rainfall and temperature. One of the economic activities on which the effects of global warming will be observed the most is agriculture, livestock and aquaculture. They stand out among the main effects: the modification in crops, due to the increase in the atmosphere in the concentration of carbon dioxide; greater probability of an increase in the pest population, and adjustments in the demand and supply of water for irrigation.</p>

<h4>National adaptation priorities, strategies, policies, plans, goals and actions</h4>

<p>From an adaptation perspective, with the update of the CDN1 of Panama, it is sought to promote climate resilience and reduce the risk of the effects of climate change. The commitments made will be progressive and will be implemented through a participatory and transparent approach, based on our national circumstances.</p>
<p>The country has identified commitments in 10 priority sectors and areas, addressed under a comprehensive approach to climate change and relevant to adaptation, detailed below. For more information, go to section 9 of the updated Panama CDN1, in which the information is developed according to the commitments from a comprehensive adaptation-mitigation vision.</p>
<p>The table on page 124 - page 128 is not included in the HTML on Climate Watch, see the original document at <a href="https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Panama%20First/CDN1%20Actualizada%20Rep%C3%BAblica%20de%20Panam%C3%A1.pdf">NDC Registry</a> </p>
<h4>Implementation needs and support received</h4>

<p>Within the framework of the Technological Needs Assessment for climate change (ENT), Report on identification and prioritization of technologies for the Adaptation of the Water Resources sector, of 2017; Panama develops a series of products in accordance with the commitments acquired around the NCD, with the purpose of responding to its specific needs and priorities around the sector (MiAMBIENTE 2017).</p>
<p>In the ENT, within the framework of CONACCP, the water resources sector, the drinking water and sanitation subsector, is identified as priority attention, taking into account:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>The strategic priority of attention of the national government: considering strategic planning instruments such as the National Water Security Plan 2015-2050, which establishes the guarantee of water security in a changing climate and the preventive management of risks related to water, as well as strengthen integrated management for water sustainability;</li>
<li>That adaptation to climate change and the reduction of vulnerability in water resources are issues of national interest, as well as the contribution of resilience to society, which are guidelines consistent with the National Policy on Climate Change approved since 2007;</li>
<li>That strategically, the inter-institutional coordination scheme through CONACCP is the relevant one for the actions of the ENT, where the participation of 27 government institutions is considered at the same time that participation is expanded to academia and international organizations, to have a extensive knowledge network on the subject of climate change in their respective sectors.</li>
</ol>

<p>According to the bibliographic review and technical documents in the framework of water management in Panama, as well as the web pages of the institutions involved in the subject of study and interested parties that have participated in workshops within the framework of the ENT, made a list of the probable technologies that can address the problem related to drinking water and sanitation, particularly for the Arco Seco area. This list of technologies is presented in Table 2 and which is explained below (MiAMBIENTE 2017).</p>
<p>In order to fully focus on the aspects established in the barrier analysis phase, the subsequent stages will consider only 5 technologies with the highest percentage achieved to more objectively conduct their analysis from their contextualization to reality, the environment conducive to their development. development and even its economic dimension for its implementation (Table 2).</p>

<h4>Table 2. Technologies presented to the National Committee for NCD and CONACCP, for their evaluation and consideration.</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preparation of water balances in priority hydrographic basins as a contribution to the Integrated Management of Hydrographic Basins and Climate Change.</li>
<li>Development of regulations (hydrogeological methodology and procedures) to identify, delimit and classify the country's aquifers.</li>
<li>Development of a technical manual to carry out projects for artificial recharge of aquifers (methodology and procedures).</li>
<li>Evaluation of the impact of saline intrusion on coastal aquifers and the delimitation of areas vulnerable to contamination by salinization.</li>
<li>Identification and planning of actions for the control of floods before floods due to intense rain events for their use.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Taken from: Report on the Assessment of Technological Needs to Climate Change, Report on Identification and Prioritization of Technologies for Adaptation of the Water Resources Sector, 2017</em></p>
<p>The next steps will involve the identification and analysis of the opportunities or barriers of its enabling environment or the enabling environment of each of the identified technologies, taking into account the institutional and regulatory conditions and the political framework that leads to the promotion and facilitation of the technology transfer and diffusion.</p>
<p>In this way, it will be possible to generate the appropriate framework to continue the NCD development process, as well as to continue the work with the interested parties through the creation of spaces for dialogue and consultation workshops, taking advantage of other parallel processes and executing them simultaneously. . All this, having the purpose of adequately articulating the different environmental and climate change dimensions in public and sectoral policies, as well as human, organizational and institutional capacity (MiAMBIENTE, 2017).</p>

<h4>Implementation of adaptation actions and / or plans</h4>

<p>A key milestone for the implementation of adaptation is the national adaptation planning process (NAP). This process will be carried out with the support of preparatory funds from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), in conjunction with UN Environment as an execution partner, for its presentation and formalization as of 2021. This process includes support for the preparation of the indicated sector plans as commitments in the updated CDN1.</p>
<p>In parallel, the country is implementing the "Program for Adaptation to Climate Change through Integrated Management of Water Resources in Panama", in execution since 2018 with resources from the Adaptation Fund.</p>
<p>Likewise, projects with climate adaptation components have been implemented, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project for the protection of carbon stocks in mangroves and protected areas executed from 2014 to 2017 with resources from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Protection, Public Works and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) through the International Initiative for Climate Protection (ICI) and participation of the Ministry of the Environment, the Aquatic Resources Authority, Conservation International and Wetlands International.</li>
<li>Joint Program Incorporation of measures for adaptation and mitigation of climate change in the management of natural resources in two priority basins in Panama. Study of current and future vulnerability to climate change and adaptation and mitigation measures in the Tabasará and Chucunaque river basins (2010).</li>
</ul>

<p>The monitoring, reporting and verification mechanism that includes the development of the national platform for climate transparency, established as one of the commitments to strengthen capacities for climate transparency, will be a key element to facilitate coherence and complementarity between climate initiatives, in such a way that synergies are maximized and more far-reaching impacts are achieved.</p>

<h4>Information related to adaptation.</h4>

<h4>Economic adaptation / diversification, mitigation co-benefits.</h4>
<p>A key characteristic of the climate action process undertaken by Panama is to promote an integrated mitigation-adaptation approach, in order to overcome the adaptation-mitigation dichotomy. To this end, it is sought that the actions that are advanced in the 10 priority sectors and areas generate climate adaptation and mitigation benefits, while contributing to the objectives of sustainable development and economic recovery. In the commitments described, the mitigation benefits derived are mentioned, which, although they have not been proposed as GHG targets, do have the potential to generate measurable mitigation results in the medium and long term.</p>

<h4>How adaptation contributes to other international frameworks.</h4>

<p>The commitments listed in the updated CRC1 contribute to the advancement of the 2030 Agenda, as observed in the detail of each commitment provided in section 4. Likewise, with the sectoral commitments presented in forests; biodiversity; marine-coastal systems; integrated management of hydrographic basins; sustainable agriculture, livestock and aquaculture; sustainable infrastructure and resilient human settlements, it contributes to advance the commitments acquired through the Biodiversity Convention, Ramsar Convention, Convention to Combat Desertification and the Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the CDN1 implementation process will be the determination of the mechanisms to demonstrate and monitor these links, establishing the corresponding data exchange protocols and metrics. The implementation of the climate transparency platform will allow progress in the systematization and strategic use of information and data, so that it can be measured and reported on how climate adaptation actions are allowing to advance other objectives.</p>

<h4>Gender-sensitive adaptation and traditional / indigenous / local knowledge.</h4>

<p>The updated CRC1 expressly establishes the need for climate action to contribute to the objectives of fighting poverty and inequity, which limit the sustainable development of the country. In this sense, the special vulnerability of women and indigenous populations is recognized.</p>

<h3 id="anexo-c.-proceso-de-actualización-de-la-cdn1">ANNEX C. UPDATE PROCESS OF THE PANAMA CDN1</h3>

<p>The updating of the CDN1 of the Republic of Panama was carried out through a broad, systematic and multisectoral participatory process of joint construction and validation of sectoral commitments, led by the MiAMBIENTE through the Directorate of Climate Change, the focal point of the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>With this objective, technical teams of specialists responsible for each sector or strategic area were formed. For each one, the governing sector entities and those directly involved were identified (see Table 1 below), with whom a collaborative work was developed to jointly define the commitments, in order to ensure proper institutional ownership.</p>
<p>The collaborative work consisted of: (1) bibliographic review and analysis of political and national development priorities; (2) preliminary preparation of possible commitments on climate change and their prioritization by the governing entity; (3) successive work meetings of the technical teams until a consensus is reached regarding the scope, foundation, follow-up mechanisms, among other operational aspects of each commitment; (4) various sectoral surveys for justification and technical support in light of national circumstances and ambition in the face of the climate crisis; (5) space for socialization and feedback through workshops with strategic actors (detail is presented below);</p>

<h4>Virtual Workshops with Strategic Actors</h4>

<p>In order to ensure the participation of all sectors of Panamanian society in updating the CDN1, the MiAMBIENTE led the design and implementation of a broad process of active listening and participation. The process was led by the technical team of the MiAMBIENTE Climate Change Directorate as exhibitors / facilitators, and had the methodological support of international cooperation in specialized areas of communication and participation, given the multisectoral and multidisciplinary nature of the process of CDN1 update.</p>
<p>Regarding the audience, six (6) main groups of interested parties / actors were identified: local governments, public sector, private sector, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and scientific community. For the identification of the participants, relevant guest lists were prepared by sector, to which the invitation was circulated, in addition to being widely circulated through the MiAMBIENTE social networks to ensure the widest possible participation.</p>
<p>In order to inform about the importance and scope of the CRC and make the participants part of the update process, 9 virtual workshops were held between September 29 and November 26, 2020, with a total of 420 participants; who provided important inputs to improve clarity, transparency and acceptance of commitments (see Table 2 below).</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in compliance with the mobility and biosafety restriction measures due to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the sessions were held in virtual mode. The sessions were recorded and there is a detailed record of each one, including the session's agenda, the speakers, the materials used, the participants and the results of the interactive dynamics; which are available on the MiAMBIENTE website.</p>
