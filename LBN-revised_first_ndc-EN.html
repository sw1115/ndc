  <h1>Lebanon's Nationally Determined Contribution </h1>
  <p>Updated 2020 Version</p>
<h2 class="list-paragraph" id="executive-summary">Executive Summary </h2>
<p>Amid the significant gap between the aggregate effect of greenhouse gas emission reductions announced in the 2015 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the emissions pathway consistent with the Paris Agreement goal, the global call for ambition should be met with an increase in climate action efforts. Moreover, the IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways clearly calls for stronger mitigation measures, as well as enhanced resilience, in order to avoid catastrophic climate changes.</p>
<p><strong>The Republic of Lebanon is submitting an update to its 2015 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)</strong> in accordance with Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement (and Law 115/2019) to respond to this call for enhancement and to meet the goals of the Agreement. Lebanon firmly believes in combatting the climate crisis by adopting a pathway towards sustainable development.</p>
<p><strong>This update comes at a time when Lebanon is facing economic, financial, monetary, and banking crises which significantly impact economic output, livelihoods, and development.</strong> Several reforms packages are under development to bring Lebanon unto a more sustainable and positive development path. Lebanon will need international support to successfully overcome the economic downturn, and to sustainably rebuild its economy and the resilience of its society.</p>
<p><strong>Despite its hardships, Lebanon remains committed to fighting the climate crisis.</strong> This will entail policy and fiscal reforms to enable the improvement of the energy and transport sectors through energy efficiency, the sustainable use of Lebanon’s land and water resources, the reduction of polluting practices in agriculture, waste, and industry, and enhancing the resilience of communities and infrastructure. These solutions go in tandem with Lebanon’s economic recovery and would increase revenue to the government, which are crucial steps to emerge from the current crisis. <strong>This NDC update is therefore aligned with the economic recovery effort and while providing complementary sustainable solutions to Lebanon’s challenges.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, Lebanon prioritizes the consideration of the socio-economic status of the most vulnerable through a gender lens. Finally, this NDC will be achieved only if all national stakeholders (including nonstate actors such as municipalities) cooperate and the international community supports Lebanon during these difficult times.</p>
<p>The most notable updates of this 2020 NDC are:</p>
<p><strong>Increase in mitigation ambition and transparency</strong></p>


<p>Lebanon commits to unconditionally increase its greenhouse gas emission reduction target relative to the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario from 15% to 20%, and conditionally increasing its GHG emission reduction target relative to the BAU scenario from 30% to 31%.</p>
<p>Lebanon commits to unconditionally generate 18% of its power Increase in mitigation demand (i.e. electricity demand) and 11% of its heat demand (in the ambition and transparency building sector) from renewable energy sources in 2030, compared to a combined 15% in 2015. Moreover, Lebanon conditionally commits to generate 30% of its power demand (i.e. electricity demand) and 16.5% of its heat demand (in the building sector) from renewable energy sources in 2030, compared to a combined 20% in 2015.</p>

<p>This NDC provides additional information on the mitigation targets through the guidance on Information to provide Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU) in Decision 4/CMA.1.</p>

<p><strong>Increase in adaptation action clarity</strong></p>
<p>More clarity is provided on Lebanon’s adaptation guiding principles and priorities, forming part of its adaptation communication.</p>
<p>Adaptation priorities include strengthening of the agricultural sector's resilience, sustainable use of natural resources, developing sustainable water services, managing terrestrial and marine biodiversity, reducing vulnerability of coastal zones, ensuring public health safety and reducing disaster risk.</p>


<p><strong>Enhance synchronization</strong></p>
<p>Lebanon’s NDC targets and implementation are synchronized with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as other related conventions to maximize efficiency and partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Improve integration and inclusiveness</strong></p>



<p>The importance of a whole-of-society approach has been considered in this NDC by prioritizing vulnerable groups in climate action.</p>



<h2 id="national-circumstances">1. National Circumstances </h2>
<p>Lebanon faces an unprecedented <strong>economic, financial, monetary, and banking crisis</strong>. An accumulation of large budget deficits has significantly increased the debt-to-GDP ratio. Moreover, the <strong>Lebanese Pound has devalued, while inflation rates soared,</strong> impacting the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of Lebanese citizens. The fact that Lebanon relies on imports for most of its food and energy supplies has aggravated the situation even further. The <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> has exacerbated conditions whereby the government-imposed lockdowns that further lowered economic activity.</p>
<p>On August 4<sup>th</sup>, 2020, <strong>an explosion</strong> occurred at the port of Beirut which damaged the Port infrastructure, and surrounding area; the cost of damage is estimated between 3.8 and 4.6 billion US Dollars<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. This further sets back an already struggling economy and has halted a large area of commercial activity and essential services: the consequent physical capital losses of the blast are expected to cause an additional decline in GDP, estimated at 0.4 to 0.6 percentage points<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Since 2011, Lebanon has been dealing with a crippling humanitarian crisis due the <strong>displaced Syrian population</strong>, which has stretched an already fragile public infrastructure with demands exceeding the capacity of institutions to meet the required needs. The lack of security caused by the regional turmoil adds another layer of paralysis. Therefore, Lebanon once again considers that the achievement of its targets presumes:</p>
<ul><li>
The reinstatement, as soon as possible, of the prevailing national circumstances prior to the latest regional crisis, a matter considered as Lebanon’s legitimate right;</li>
<li>The absence of the emergence of any new crisis which could adversely affect Lebanon’s national circumstances.</li></ul>

<p>Lebanon is experiencing a multi-faceted crisis, which will only worsen with climatic impacts. Therefore, <strong>Lebanon’s priority for the next decade is to spur sustainable growth through the creation of decent jobs and improve the well-being of its population through welfare programmes and protection of natural resources.</strong> Consequently, the implementation of this NDC consists of inherent components in Lebanon’s economic recovery path, while reaffirming Lebanon’s commitment to the climate fight.</p>
<p>It is under these circumstances, and in accordance with Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement and Law 115/2019, that Lebanon presents its updated 2020 NDC, which can only be achieved through the cooperation of all national stakeholders and the invaluable support of the international community during these difficult times.</p>
<h2 id="climate-action-for-sustainable-development-and-a-green-economy">2. Climate Action for Sustainable Development and a Green Economy </h2>
<p>Lebanon’s roadmap to macroeconomic stability amid the number of challenges it is facing will need to be green, inclusive, and conform with the <strong>leave no one behind</strong> principle. The aim is to drive sustainable, lowemission growth, as well as increase the resilience of the economy, communities and ecosystems to sustain any future shocks, including climate events. The government has put forth several plans and reforms agendas to attract foreign investments and aid to put the country on a long-term sustainable growth trajectory, including the CEDRE-CIP (Conference Economique pour le Développement par les Reformes avec les Entreprises – Capital Investment Program)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, the Lebanon Economic Vision (LEV)<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and the Government Financial Recovery Plan<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Moreover, several ministerial strategies are shifting their missions by reiterating the priority to drive sustainable economic growth. Moreover, a climate-proofing analysis of the above plans has been conducted to secure harmonization with the Paris Agreement mandate.</p>
<p><strong>This NDC update is synchronized with these plans and reforms</strong> and most of the proposed courses of action are already stated in endorsed ministerial strategies and plans, which together form Lebanon’s international commitment.</p>
<p>Lebanon’s NDC, in addition to reducing national greenhouse gas emissions, will also improve air quality, enhance food security, reduce poverty and vulnerability, create job opportunities, protect the environment and green cities, and improve social welfare and boost economic growth. Moreover, in the energy sector it will increase its robustness, security, reliability, sustainability and independence, which will reduce the burden on the government budget and alleviate the fiscal deficit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, climate action enables the move to a green and blue economy by removing barriers to clean investments and solidifying demand for greener products and services through sound economic incentives and regulation. Moving towards a green economy in Lebanon satisfies the concept of sustainable development since it aims for high human development, with a reduced ecological impact. Lebanon’s draft Low Emission Development Strategy’s (LEDS) objectives are in line with this principle, by visualizing a circular economy, enhanced research and development, and decoupled economic growth and GHG emissions. <strong>This NDC is a steppingstone to achieving the LEDS objectives in 2050.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lebanon prioritizes a just transition through the consideration of the socio-economic status of the most vulnerable, adopting a gender-responsive approach.</strong> This is in line with the Government of Lebanon’s adherence to the Secretary-General’s 2019 Climate Action Summit declaration on Social and Political drivers, which aims at “ensuring that the economic, environmental and social aspects of the transformation of economies and societies towards greater sustainability are managed in ways that maximize opportunities of decent work for all, reduce inequalities, promote social justice, and enhance country’s efforts to improve the people’s health.”</p>
<h2 id="climate-action-enablers">3. Climate Action Enablers </h2>
<p>Measures for sustainable development and climate action are most effective if based on robust governance mechanisms, regulations and partnerships. Lebanon therefore views these elements as Climate Action Enablers which are crucial to sustained and more ambitious actions to achieve the NDC. Moreover, these enablers contribute to the achievement of numerous Sustainable Development Goals, including SDGs 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Several enablers below are already underway, and others have been prioritized for implementation.</p>
<p><em>CAE1: Improved Governance and Institutional Capacities</em></p>
<p>Lebanon prioritizes climate governance as the enabling of institutions to plan, prepare and react to climate change. Building the needed institutional capacities to reform, analyze, coordinate and regulate climate and sustainable development action is essential. This is particularly important for climate policy coherence, efficiency, integration and mainstreaming, which are the building blocks of effective and informed green reforms.</p>


<p><em>CAE2: Incentivized Action and Fiscal Reform</em></p>
<p>Lebanon strives to derisk climate-relevant investments both for the public and private sectors, as it is of the essence to accelerate the deployment of climate-friendly technologies, especially renewable energy<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Additionally, fiscal incentives and disincentives are necessary to operationalize the “Polluter Pays Principle” across all relevant emitting sectors to fast-track the shift to greener options, such as Decree 167/2017 which reduces corporate tax/customs fees based on clean technology uptake, Article 55 of 2018 Budget Law which provides tax exemptions for electric vehicles and tax reductions for hybrid vehicles, and Law 77/2018 and its amended version 192/2020, where the Water Code lists penalties for polluters. Finally, climate-proofing public and private investments and projects is necessary to avoid climatenegative projects.</p>
<p><em>CAE3: Strengthened Partnerships</em></p>
<p> The role of Non-State Actors (NSAs), including the private sector and Civil Society Organizations is primordial to implement climate action. It is therefore important to scale-up the existing partnerships with NSAs to enable their increased involvement in mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as climate advocacy. Moreover, the Government of Lebanon is prioritizing the ease of doing business as depicted in its financial recovery plan, which will contribute to increased contributions from the private sector.</p>
<p><em>CAE4: Innovative Research and Development Encouraged</em></p>
<p>Lebanon aims to reduce the carbon intensity of its economy through stimulating Research and Development for low carbon and sustainable technologies. In addition, Lebanon needs to improve its scientific aptitude to better guide decision-making. It is therefore important to foster an innovative environment by sustainably enhancing the capabilities of the private sector, driving large public investments for research and piloting, partnering with academic bodies to provide the needed readiness for transformational change, and encouraging innovation labs.</p>
<p><em>CAE5: Comprehensive Integration</em></p>
<p>Integrated solutions to the climate crisis, as well as economic recovery, cannot be performed without the effective inclusion of gender institutions, youth groups and vulnerable communities. Lebanon plans to revise its policymaking process to include these groups which are key to the success of the NDC and are the most impacted by climate impacts.</p>
<p><em>CAE6: Enhanced Monitoring and Transparency</em> </p>
<p>Clarity and effectiveness of action can only be guaranteed through a robust monitoring and transparency framework, tackling climate and sustainable development action, as well as support. In order to enhance the impacts of policymaking, and to successfully participate in tracking the global progress of the climate fight, a transparency framework will be established to improve institutional arrangements, data availability and periodicity, as well as monitoring and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation projects.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation-contribution">Mitigation Contribution </h2>
<p>Lebanon is updating the mitigation targets included in its 2015 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in accordance with paragraphs 9 of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement and Law 115/2019, paragraph 24 of Decision 1/CP.21 and paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of Decision 1/CMA.2, to respond to the urgent global call for enhanced ambition in order to meet the Paris Agreement’s goals, considering Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) in light of national circumstances, and in line with the Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit declaration on Mitigation Strategy, which Lebanon joined in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>This NDC represents a progression beyond Lebanon’s 2015 NDC</strong> by unconditionally increasing its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission target relative to the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario from 15% to 20%, and conditionally increasing its GHG emission target relative to the BAU scenario from 30% to 31%. Moreover, Lebanon commits to unconditionally generate 18% of the power demand (i.e. electricity demand) and 11% of its heat demand (in the building sector) from renewable energy sources in 2030, compared to a combined 15% in 2015. Conditionally, Lebanon commits to generate 30% of the power demand (i.e. electricity demand) and 16.5% of its heat demand (in the building sector) from renewable energy sources in 2030, compared to a combined 20% in 2015 (guided by the IRENA Renewable Energy Outlook: Lebanon<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>). Lebanon believes that enhanced climate ambition is needed from all countries despite climate vulnerability, as increased mitigation leads to a decrease in adaptation needs.</p>
<p>The NDC GHG targets have been methodologically updated to reflect the national GHG inventory with the use of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the 100-year time-horizon GWP values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report.</p>
<p><strong>Most of the proposed courses of action to implement the mitigation NDC are already alluded to in endorsed ministerial strategies and plans, as well as reports,</strong> such as the Policy Paper for Electricity sector (PPES) 2019, the 2020 National Water Sector Strategy (NWSS), the 2020 Ministry of Agriculture Strategy, the Oil and Gas Strategic Environmental Assessment, and the 2020 IRENA Renewable Energy Outlook: Lebanon, the National Cooling Plan (NCP), among others, which together form Lebanon’s international commitment. Lebanon’s GHG target is economy-wide, and includes mitigation efforts from the energy, transport, forestry, agriculture, waste and industrial sectors to achieve its NDC. Moreover, almost all planned mitigation actions have sustainable development co-benefits.</p>
<p>The implementation of the above-mentioned Climate Action Enablers is crucial to the achievement of the targets put forward in this update.</p>

<p>Lebanon will track progress and achievement of the unconditional and conditional targets listed above in its first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) and onwards, contingent on adequate support.</p>
<p><strong>Additional information on the mitigation targets is provided in the Annex to this submission. Lebanon has used the guidance on Information to provide Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU) in Decision 4/CMA.1.</strong></p>
<h2 id="adaptation">Adaptation </h2>
<h3 id="impacts-of-climate-change-in-lebanon">Impacts of Climate Change in Lebanon </h3>
<p>Climatic changes are expected to have diverse implications on Lebanon’s environment, economy, and social conditions. Extreme weather events are and will continue to impact public health, human settlements, infrastructure, agricultural output, power supply and the economy at large. The fragile biodiversity, ecosystems, and natural habitats will be threatened by increased forest fires, pest outbreaks sea level rise, storm intensity and drought.</p>
<p>Moreover, a decrease in snow cover, water availability, agricultural productivity, including fisheries and aquaculture, and tourism would impose heavy economic costs. Moreover, studies show that for particularly dry years, when total annual precipitation is low, overall GDP is estimated to have lost more than 60% compared to years when total precipitation reached its optimal.</p>
<p>These effects, in turn, would lower incomes for households and businesses, reduce revenues and increase costs to the government.</p>
<p><strong>Therefore, adverse climate impacts will add an additional layer of challenges and sets back any improvement in the Lebanese socio-economic status. Lebanon views climate change as a threat multiplier to its current struggles which makes tackling the climate crisis a global priority, and swift adaptation a national one.</strong></p>
<h3 id="adaptation-priorities">Adaptation Priorities </h3>
<p><strong>Lebanon will increase its resilience to climate change in tandem with enhancing resilience against economic shocks and other possible disasters.</strong> Therefore, Lebanon is prioritizing the synchronization of adaptation action with the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Moreover, Lebanon acknowledges that vulnerable groups, especially women, are disproportionately impacted by climatic events, and will therefore commit to render climate adaptation action gender responsive.</p>
<p>Below are guiding principles and sectoral adaptation priorities which, together, aim <strong>to preserve and restore the natural capital and enhance and protect the built capital, as well as livelihoods, to ensure sustainable growth and resilience to climate change.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>these principles and priorities are in line with the relevant national sectoral strategies a</strong>nd will inform Lebanon’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP), w. Furthermore, the most relevant SDGs are listed per sectoral priority; Lebanon considers the SDGs 5 (gender equality), 13 (climate action), 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and 17 (partnerships for the goals) to be inherent in the successful achievement of the adaptation priorities and are therefore considered relevant to all actions.</p>
<p><strong>The achievement of the different adaptation priorities is highly interactive.</strong> Moreover, the implementation of the above-mentioned Climate Action Enablers is crucial to the achievement of the adaptation priorities.</p>
<p>Finally, as per paragraph 11 of Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, Law 115/2019 and paragraph 11 of Decision 9/CMA.1, the below priorities correspond to <em>(c) National adaptation priorities, strategies, policies, plans, goals and actions</em> of the Annex of Decision 9/CMA.1 (Further guidance in relation to the adaptation communication, including, inter alia, as a component of nationally determined contributions, referred to in Article 7, paragraphs 10 and 11, of the Paris Agreement and Law 115/2019). <strong>Therefore, the below priorities constitute part of Lebanon’s Adaptation Communication in accordance with paragraph 10 of Article 7 of the Paris Agreement and Law 115/2019.</strong></p>
<p>Lebanon’s adaptive capacity and resilience depend on international support in the form of finance, technology transfer, capacity-building, and technical assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding Adaptation Principles</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Achieve food and water security through the sustainable management of resources</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance the resilience of the infrastructure, urban and rural areas to subsist climaterelated disasters</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure and protect public health, well-being and safety of all communities through climateresilient systems</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate Nature-Based Solutions as a first line of defense from adverse impacts of climate change</p></li>
<li><p>Combat desertification and land degradation by achieving Land Degradation Neutrality</p></li>
<li><p>Substantially reduce the risk of climate and non-climate related disasters to protect lives, the economy and physical and natural assets</p></li>

<h2 id="support-needed-for-ndc-implementation-and-achievement">6. Support Needed for NDC Implementation and Achievement </h2>
<p>The NDC’s implementation depends on adequate and predictable climate and sustainable development finance, as well as economic and political stability, and the enhanced capacity of Lebanese institutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>Lebanon is working towards the establishment of the Lebanon Green Investment Facility (LGIF)</strong> as stipulated in the Government’s Financial Recovery Plan, to provide climate and green finance through accessible and affordable finance instruments for both the public and private sectors, as well as to provide needed technical assistance to various entities to create bankable projects. The LGIF is foreseen to substantially contribute to the implementation of the NDC by increasing investments to climate-friendly projects, through strong donor and investor coordination mechanism and capitalization strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>Lebanon is currently developing a climate-proofing methodology</strong> which aims to assess and reduce the impacts of climatenegative projects, as well as potentially guide the evaluation of investments, through a climatelens. Ultimately, Lebanon intends to explore the possibility of greening foreign investments including Official Development Assistance (ODA) to accelerate the achievement of the NDC and avoid locking in carbon emissions on the longterm. Finally, the consideration of Environmental and Social Standards (ESS), as well as gender-responsiveness should be included in projects’ evaluation and implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Further support is strongly needed from the international donor community to overcome the many challenges Lebanon is facing</strong>, including mitigating and adapting to climate change. This support includes finance, capacitybuilding and technology transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity-building of government institutions and Non-State Actors to mitigate and adapt to climate change</strong>. More importantly, capacitybuilding support is needed to operationalize the Climate Action Enablers which act as means of implementation for climate action and sustainable development. Capacity development for reform and recovery is of essence to put Lebanese institutions on track to carry-out the required actions.</p>
<p>In this period of economic rebuild, <strong>technology transfer is essential to access the best available technologies to avoid additional GHG emissions and increase adaptive capacities</strong>. Sectors such as industry, agriculture, waste, energy and buildings could greatly benefit from technologies which enhance resource and production efficiency to encourage circular economy. Moreover, <strong>the innovative digitalization of climate action</strong> is foreseen to maximize the efficiency and sustainability of the green transition.</p>
<p><strong>Lebanon plans to make its support needs clear, starting with the Green Climate Fund (GCF)’s country programme for Lebanon.</strong> The programme plans to provide guidance for investors and donors on NDC priorities, which will be in line with the planned investments for economic recovery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <strong>NDC Partnership Plans under development will deliver an overview of sectoral enabling activities and needs</strong> for the implementation of the NDC, both for climate action and climate transparency.</p>

<li>The implementation of Lebanon’s NDC, as well as the development of the LowEmission Development Strategy (LEDS), has been mandated by the official economic recovery plan of Lebanon, prioritizing climate action in the reform process. Therefore, the integration of the NDC into higher-level governmentally endorsed plan enhances climate action.



<li><p>This NDC highlights the important linkages between climate action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Lebanon assessed the relationship between the sectoral adaptation and mitigation policies and the 169 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) sub-targets which resulted in numerous synergies in implementation and tracking. This exercise contributes to fully synchronizing the planning of climate action and sustainable development, which is made clear in this NDC.</p></li>

<p>1. To quantify the GHG emissions level in the projected BAU scenario in 2030, the following assumptions were made for emission growth drivers:</p>
<p>Population growth was estimated to be 1.65% annually till 2030, based on World Bank estimates.</p>
<p>Moreover, when it comes to energy emissions, it was assumed that electricity demand will increase by 3.5% annually and that electricity demand which cannot be satisfied by the installed generation capacity, continues to be largely satisfied through private diesel generators. Also, in the BAU scenario, electricity production is decreasing by 1.3% per year due to the degradation of power plants. Finally, exploration activities in the offshore oil and gas sector has started in 2020 with the drilling of the first deep water well. However emission-intensive production and development operations are not expected to start before 2028, potentially contributing to the increase in GHG emissions level.</p>
<p>For transport emissions, it was assumed that the fleet will be increasing by 3% annually. As for agriculture, emissions remain stable in the BAU scenario. As for forestry, due to an increase in deforestation, increase in forest fires and urban sprawl, the LULUCF sink is limited at a rate of 1% per year. Both the agriculture and forestry assumptions were made based on the time series analysis. As for waste emissions, generation is estimated to increase with population growth and with waste generation per capita increasing from 1.05 to 1.30 kg/capita/day.</p>

<p>Finally, industrial emissions are estimated to increase by 2.5% annually.</p>


<p>2.To quantify the reference point, the following assumptions were made for heat and power demand (i.e. electricity demand) growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Heat demand: heat demand has been considered only for the building sector based on data availability.</p></li>
<li><p>Power demand: Electricity demand increases by 3.5% annually; the electricity demand which cannot be satisfied by the installed generation capacity, continues to be largely met through private diesel generators.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<td><p>This NDC represents a progression beyond Lebanon’s 2015 NDC by unconditionally increasing its</p>
<p>GHG emission target relative to the BAU scenario from 15% to 20%, and conditionally increasing its GHG emission target relative to the BAU scenario from 30% to 31%. Moreover, Lebanon commits to unconditionally generate 18% of the power demand (i.e. electricity demand) and 11% of its heat demand in the building sector from renewable energy sources in 2030, compared to a combined 15% in 2015. Conditionally, Lebanon commits to generate 30% of the power demand (i.e. electricity demand) and 16.5% of its heat demand in the building sector from renewable energy sources in 2030, compared to a combined 20% in 2015.</p>
<p>The BAU level in 2030 changed due to the use of the IPCC 2006 guidelines as opposed to the 1996 Revised IPCC Guidelines used in the 2015 NDC, adding 0.97 percentage points to the 15% 2015 unconditional target, and adding 0.45 percentage points to the 30% 2015 conditional target. Despite this change, the 2020 NDC targets have increased to reach 20% unconditionally and 31% conditionally, due to increased mitigation effort.</p>
