<p>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a Party to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The UK’s NDC represents a single, economy-wide emissions reduction target for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The UK employs a range of institutional structures – at national, sub-national and local level - to enable economy-wide emissions mitigation, as well as numerous policies and measures to underpin delivery.</p>
<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) is responsible for the strategic oversight of the UK’s international climate and energy policy, and for the UK Government’s domestic climate and energy policy. The Devolved Administrations<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have control over certain policy areas to deliver emissions reductions, while the UK Government retains control over a number of other policy areas. The approach taken by each government will differ, drawing on the range of powers at their disposal.</p>
<p>The legally binding Climate Change Act (2008) sets a framework for the UK to reduce GHG emissions and build capacity to adapt and strengthen resilience to climate risks.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Act originally committed the UK to cut its emissions by at least 80% below the 1990 baseline level by 2050.<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> In 27 June 2019, this target was amended, committing the UK to a legally- binding target of net zero emissions by 2050, set on a whole-economy basis.</p>
<p>The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance. The first five carbon budgets cover the period from 2008-32, with the sixth carbon budget (2033-38) due to be set by mid-2021.</p>
<p>The Act also established the CCC – the independent statutory body that advises the UK Government and Devolved Administrations on climate change mitigation and adaptation, including emissions reduction targets. When providing advice, the CCC considers the UK’s international obligations under the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC.</p>
<p>As climate change policy is devolved, the Devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales have their own statutory emissions reduction targets. Progress towards these targets also contributes to achievement of UK-wide targets.</p>
<p>The Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Act 2019 amends the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, raising the ambition of Scotland’s domestic targets. This sets in law Scotland’s target to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2045, and interim targets of 56%, 75% and 90% reductions in emissions by 2020, 2030 and 2040 respectively, relative to a 1990/1995 baseline. Scotland sets annual targets, in contrast to the five-yearly carbon budgets set by the UK and Welsh Governments.</p>
<p>The Environment (Wales) Act (2016)<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> requires Welsh Ministers to reduce all emissions in Wales by at least 80% by 2050, against a 1990/1995 baseline. In 2018 the Senedd endorsed the CCC’s recommendations and set Wales’s targets for 2020 (27%), 2030 (45%) and 2040 (67%), as well as Wales’s first two carbon budgets (2016-20 and 2021-25). Following further advice from the CCC, in 2021 the Welsh Government will ask the Senedd to legislate more ambitious targets to 2050, including for 2030.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland contributes to UK-wide carbon budgets. Northern Ireland’s current energy strategy is set out in the Strategic Energy Framework for the period 2010-20.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Northern Ireland’s Department for the Economy is progressing the development of a new longer-term energy strategy to cover the period 2020 to 2050 within the context of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>For more information on the UK and Devolved Administrations approach to tackling climate change, please see Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 4 of the UK’s Fourth Biennial Report<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> and the CCC’s Insight Briefings.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The decision on the UK’s NDC headline target was led by BEIS and agreed through UK Government governance structures at official and ministerial levels. The target level in the UK's NDC was informed by the UK’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, the legally-binding net zero commitment, and guidance from the CCC. The ICTU was prepared in collaboration with UK Government departments and the Devolved Administrations.</p>
<p><strong>Policies and measures</strong></p>
<p>Delivery of the UK’s NDC will draw on a range of policies and measures already in place, as well as policies and measures that will be developed in the future. For example, in November 2020, the UK Prime Minister set out his ambitious Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution. Spanning clean energy, buildings, transport, nature and innovative technologies, the plan will mobilise £12 billion of government investment to create and support up to 250,000 highly-skilled green jobs in the UK, and unlock three times as much private sector investment by 2030.<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>More broadly, the Clean Growth Strategy<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> describes the UK Government’s current policies and measures to decarbonise all sectors of the UK economy through the 2020s and beyond. Ahead of COP26, the UK intends to publish a comprehensive Net Zero Strategy, setting out the government’s vision for transitioning to a net zero economy by 2050, making the most of new growth and employment opportunities across the UK. The Net Zero Strategy will constitute the UK’s revised Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy to the UNFCCC. The UK also intends to publish ambitious individual plans across key sectors of the economy, including an Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan, England Peat Strategy and Heat and Buildings Strategy ahead of COP26.</p>
<p>The UK is dedicated to promoting equality and inclusion, including women’s empowerment and gender equality. Public authorities must fulfil responsibilities set out under the UK’s Equality Act (2010),<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> which covers a range of protected characteristics. The UK continues to consider equality issues in domestic decarbonisation policies. For example, specific policies and targets have been established to enhance diversity, gender equality and women’s participation in the offshore wind and nuclear sectors. These have been set out in the Offshore Wind and Nuclear Sector Deals.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is committed to delivering a green recovery after the impact of Covid-19, and plans outlined in the Programme for Government 2020/21<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> are among a range of measures to protect biodiversity, create green jobs and accelerate a just transition to net zero. Scotland’s climate change legislation requires the preparation of regular strategic delivery plans for meeting Scotland’s statutory emissions reduction targets. An update to the 2018 Climate Change Plan<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> - which covers the period to 2032 - to deliver the new and more ambitious statutory climate change targets in the 2019 Act (including a 75% reduction by 2030), and as part of a green recovery from Covid-19, will be published in December 2020.</p>
<p>In March 2019, the Welsh Government published Prosperity for All: A Low Carbon Wales,<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> setting out 100 policies and proposals from all emissions sectors and Ministerial portfolios for meeting the first Welsh carbon budget (2016-20). Many policies, for example achieving a zero-emission bus fleet by 2028, have a longer lifespan and will therefore feature in the plan for the second Welsh carbon budget (2021-25). This is due to be published in autumn 2021. The Welsh Government is keen to ensure a fair and equitable transition to a decarbonised society and is working with the Wales Centre for Public Policy to develop governance options for achieving this goal.<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>Northern Ireland’s current energy strategy is set out in the Strategic Energy Framework for the period 2010-20. Northern Ireland’s Department for the Economy is currently progressing the development of a new longer-term energy strategy to cover the period 2020 to 2050 within the context of net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p><strong>Public participation and engagement</strong></p>
<p>The level of the UK’s NDC has been informed by guidance from the CCC, in the context of the UK’s legally-binding net zero commitment. In producing its advice for government the CCC relies on a range of evidence, including expert and stakeholder sources. For example, the CCC has in the past run public calls for evidence, roundtables and workshops with non- governmental organisations (NGOs), industry stakeholders and trade associations, and held more than 200 meetings with individual stakeholders across all sectors. More information on this can be found in the CCC’s Insight Briefings.<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The UK Government sought views on the approach to decarbonising the economy in 2017, recognising that clean growth has to be a shared endeavour between government, individuals, companies from different sectors, academia, trade associations, NGOs and local government. This included several specific public consultations that were launched in 2017 and 2018.<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> Since the publication of the Clean Growth Strategy, the government has also run many other public consultations and calls for evidence relevant to the UK’s climate ambitions.<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>The approach to the UK’s NDC was discussed in meetings with NGOs, civil society and business groups, and covered in correspondence with representatives of these groups and interested Parliamentarians. A copy of the UK’s NDC will be laid in the UK’s Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>Ahead of COP26 and beyond, the UK will continue to carry out a wide range of engagement with a cross-section of society including experts, industry, non-governmental organisations, trade bodies and the wider public, which will help shape plans and policies for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. For example, the UK intends to consult next year on a net zero consistent trajectory for the cap on emissions allowances under the new UK Emissions Trading System, and plan to consult shortly on the approach to aviation in the context of the UK’s net zero ambition.</p></td>

<p><strong>Food security and policy</strong></p>
<p>The UK’s Agriculture Act<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> obligates the UK Government to produce a domestic and international food security report every three years. The UK looks forward to publishing the first report by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the UK is taking ambitious action to phase down the UK’s use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including in refrigeration equipment for food storage and distribution and promoting the uptake of sustainable refrigeration and cold chain technologies domestically and internationally. The UK Government will conduct a review of the F-gas Regulation,<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> and publish a report by the end of 2022, which will set out any further measures the UK can take to reduce HFC use in favour of climate friendly, energy efficient alternatives.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government has committed to achieving the UN SDGs, including Goal 2 on ending hunger. The SDGs are incorporated in Scotland’s National Performance Framework,<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> ensuring that these objectives are increasingly located at the centre of policy- making and delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean and marine environment</strong></p>
<p>The UK Government’s vision for the marine environment is for clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse ocean and seas. The sustainable use, protection and restoration of the UK’s marine environment is underpinned by the UK Marine and Coastal Access Act (2009),<a href="#fn31" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> the Environment Bill<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> and Fisheries Act,<a href="#fn33" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> UK Marine Policy Statement,<a href="#fn34" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> UK Marine Strategy,<a href="#fn35" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a> commitment to an ecologically coherent well-managed network of Marine Protected Areas, and Joint Fisheries Statement. The UK Government and Devolved Administrations work together closely on the UK Marine Strategy.</p>
<p>The UK Government’s National Adaptation Programme<a href="#fn36" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> outlines how the UK will address marine climate risks by introducing a Sustainable Fisheries policy, giving consideration to climate change in marine planning, building ecological resilience at sea and protecting natural carbon stores through the UK’s network of Marine Protected Areas.</p>
<p>The second Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme<a href="#fn37" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a> responds to the main climate risks for Scotland. One of seven outcomes of the Programme relates to the marine environment, and sets out actions aimed at achieving the long-term outcome that coastal and marine environments are valued, enjoyed, protected and enhanced, and has increased resilience to climate change.</p>
<p>In November 2019 the Welsh Government published the first Welsh National Marine Plan.<a href="#fn38" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> This sets out policy for the next 20 years to achieve healthy and resilient seas and marine ecosystems, in support of a thriving, sustainable economy. The Plan provides the strategic framework to enable renewable energy generation at sea.</p>
<p>The draft Marine Plan for Northern Ireland,<a href="#fn39" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> published in April 2018, supports the UK Marine Protection Strategy and the UK Government’s vision for the marine environment. The sustainable development of Northern Ireland’s marine area is further underpinned by the Marine Act (Northern Ireland) 2013<a href="#fn40" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The Plan represents the first step in sustainably managing Northern Ireland’s marine area in supporting economic, environmental and social objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Terrestrial biodiversity</strong></p>
<p>The UK will fulfil its responsibilities under the Convention on Biological Diversity, <a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> the Ramsar Convention<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> and the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature;<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> and implement the Convention on Biological Diversity’s vision that by 2050 biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintains ecosystem services, sustains a healthy planet and delivers benefits essential for all people. This will provide significant climate mitigation and adaptation benefits.</p>
<p>UK domestic biodiversity policy is devolved. In England, the UK Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan (25YEP)<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> set out the aim to support nature’s recovery and restore historical losses, including for the marine environment. Since then, the government has brought forward the Environment Bill, with measures to restore and enhance nature in England, and is developing a new Environmental Land Management scheme to achieve the 25YEP goals for nature and the net zero target. In England, the government will publish a new strategy for nature following agreement of new global biodiversity targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity, expected in 2021.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is committed to delivering improved and enduring benefits to the natural environment through the Environment Strategy for Scotland.<a href="#fn46" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Sitting beneath this, the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> will take account of the new post-2020 global biodiversity framework and targets for the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2050 vision. The Scottish Biodiversity Programme<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> has been created to coordinate all activity on biodiversity including the development of a future strategic framework for biodiversity in Scotland.</p>
<p>The Nature Recovery Action Plan (NRAP) is the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Wales.<a href="#fn49" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a> It sets out how the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and the associated Aichi Biodiversity Targets are addressed in Wales. The NRAP has been refreshed for 2020-21 to prioritise the maintenance and improvement of resilient ecological networks and transformative change. Relevant actions include developing the new Sustainable Land Management scheme and the National Forest for Wales, work to improve the condition of Protected Sites Network, and the National Peatland Action Programme. The NRAP will be realigned to address the post-2020 framework for the Convention on Biological Diversity in line with commitments made under the Edinburgh Declaration and the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) completed a public discussion exercise on a future Environment Strategy for Northern Ireland in February 2020. This will be Northern Ireland’s first overarching Environment Strategy and the findings of the public discussion will inform its development. The Department intends to issue the draft strategy for public consultation in spring 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Education and skills</strong></p>
<p>The UK Government is strengthening awareness and building consensus in tackling climate change through various education initiatives at all stages of life, including: a new education course on climate science for 16 to 18 year olds; a Green Home Grant Skills Training competition to support training for installation of energy efficient and low carbon heating measures; and initiatives as part of the UK's Sector Deal on Offshore Wind.</p>
<p>The UK also supports gender balance programmes in physics and computing to increase Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) take up amongst girls. For example, the UK Government is funding the Institute of Physics to deliver the Improving Gender Balance research trial. This randomised control trial will scale up an approach that has shown significant early promise in increasing girls’ uptake of A level physics.</p>
<p>Since 2010, there has been a 31% increase in girls’ entries to STEM A levels in England, and there are now one million women working in core STEM occupations. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of women accepted onto full-time STEM undergraduate courses also increased by 34% in the UK.</p>
<p>In December 2020, the Scottish Government will publish a Climate Emergency Skills Action Plan (CESAP) to set out long term skills opportunities and how to manage the challenge of a just transition to net zero. In addition, Scotland’s Curriculum for Excellence,<a href="#fn50" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> incorporates an emphasis on the cross-cutting theme of Learning for Sustainability – a term that brings together sustainable development education, global citizenship and outdoor learning. The Learning for Sustainability Action Plan<a href="#fn51" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a> will help to ensure that all children and young people in Scotland have the opportunity to experience this vital area of education.</p>
<p>The Welsh Government is investing in people to develop the skills needed for a low-carbon, circular economy, including reskilling workers in existing industries. The Welsh Government will seek to exploit the opportunities of this transition to secure greater added value in sectors like energy and housing (timber in construction and modular housing).</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production</strong></p>
<p>The UK is committed to delivering a national shift to healthy diets supported by a sustainable food system which contributes towards a reduction in GHG emissions.<a href="#fn52" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> The Resources and Waste Strategy<a href="#fn53" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> sets out England’s plans to move away from a linear economy, towards a more circular and sustainable economy in which natural resources are used efficiently and waste is minimised.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government recognises the transition to net zero will require significant lifestyle changes. Scotland’s Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map<a href="#fn54" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> sets out the vision that by 2040 Scotland’s buildings will be warmer, greener and more energy efficient. Scotland’s National Transport Strategy<a href="#fn55" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> sets out the commitment to implement a sustainable travel hierarchy, where people make travel choices that minimise the long term impacts on the climate and improve the lives of future generations by promoting health and wellbeing. Scotland’s Making Things Last strategy<a href="#fn56" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> sets out priorities to achieving its commitment to moving towards a more circular economy – where products and materials are kept in high value use for as long as possible. In the 2020 Programme for Government,<a href="#fn57" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> Scotland has committed to developing a local food strategy.</p>
<p>The Welsh Government has consulted on a new Circular Economy Strategy.<a href="#fn58" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> This proposed a range of actions which seek to keep resources in use for longer and avoid waste. The final strategy will be published in the coming months. The Welsh Government is also stimulating innovation through its Circular Economy Funds, awarding around £40m to businesses and publicly-funded bodies to date.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland published the second iteration of the national Waste Prevention Programme Stopping Waste in its Tracks<a href="#fn59" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> in 2019. The programme aims to decouple waste from growth and the actions contained within are designed to help Northern Ireland transition to a low- carbon circular economy.</p>
<p><strong>Health and air pollution</strong></p>
<p>The UK recognises the potential for carbon emission reduction policies to improve air quality, but also the risk that some approaches can increase human exposure to air pollution. The UK’s support decarbonisation approaches that strive to improve air quality and minimise adverse impacts on human health, balanced with action to achieve reductions in carbon emissions. Air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, which is why the UK’s Clean Air Strategy<a href="#fn60" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> sets out how the UK will tackle all types of air pollution, making the air healthier to breathe and protecting nature. This will save lives and reduce health inequalities, in line with protecting the right to health as set out in the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government published its Cleaner Air for Scotland strategy<a href="#fn61" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> in 2015 setting out a series of actions for improving air quality across a wide range of policy areas, including co- ordinated action for delivering co-benefits for both air pollutant and GHG reductions.</p>
<p>Following an independent review of the strategy in 2019, which made recommendations for additional action on air pollution over the period 2021-2025,<a href="#fn62" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> a consultation on a draft new air quality strategy for Scotland is taking place between 30 October 2020 and 22 January 2021.<a href="#fn63" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>The approach in Northern Ireland is similar to that adopted by the UK Government. Officials within DAERA recognise the policy synergies and tensions surrounding air quality and other policy areas such as climate change, energy and fuel usage and have been working collaboratively with other Northern Ireland Government Departments, on the development of a Discussion Document on the first Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland.

<td>How the Party considers that its NDC is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances</td>
<td><p>The UK’s NDC represents a step forward for the UK’s ambition to tackle climate change over the next ten years, as the UK accelerates towards meeting the legally binding commitment to net zero by 2050. It is a significant increase from the UK’s previous contribution to the EU’s Intended NDC of 40% by 2030, which was estimated to be a 53% UK reduction on reference levels.</p>
<p>The level of the NDC is consistent with advice from the CCC. The CCC stated that an NDC of at least 68% ‘would constitute a decisive commitment to a net zero emissions trajectory, consistent with the Paris Agreement’ and ‘would place the UK among the leading countries in climate ambition.’<a href="#fn68" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>BEIS led work across UK Government departments to identify the UK’s highest possible ambition, taking account of robust analysis of domestic decarbonisation potential, guidance from the CCC, the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the equity principles identified in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>b</td>
<td>Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity</td>
<td><p>The UK’s NDC target level was set taking into account the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and a range of IPCC recognised equity principles. The IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C sets out global pathways which are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels with limited or no overshoot. These show a reduction in global net anthropogenic GHG emissions of around 45% (40-60% interquartile range) by 2030 compared with 2010 levels.</p>
<p>The UK’s NDC targets a more rapid reduction than these global pathways: current estimates suggest that the UK’s NDC would reduce GHG emissions by approximately 58% on 2010 levels. By reducing emissions by at least 68% on reference year levels (1990/1995), UK emissions per person will fall from around 14 tCO2e in 1990 to fewer than 4 tCO2e in 2030.<a href="#fn69" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
