<p>November 30, 2020</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p>Grenada’s second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pursuant to <strong>Article 4</strong> of the Paris Agreement represents its continued commitment to the objectives of the Paris Agreement towards holding the increase of the global average temperature to well below 2<sup>o</sup>C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C.</p>
<p>This NDC adheres to the requirements of the guidance on information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) as contained in <strong>decision 4/ CMA 1</strong> adopted at the twenty-fourth meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 24) serving as the first Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The emissions reductions in this new NDC are a confirmation of the indicative ambitious 2030 NDC target of 40% below 2010 levels submitted in the 2016 NDC, which is conditional on external funding. This target remains the highest possible ambition that Grenada can achieve. It is anticipated that this will be done through interventions in the Energy including transport; Waste; Forestry; and Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sectors and by leveraging mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions.</p>
<p>Due to changing and unforeseen circumstances, the indicative 2030 target represents a more significant effort on the part of the state of Grenada than when it was initially proposed. Grenada will make every effort to meet and exceed the targets laid out in this NDC.</p>
<p>The NDC review process led by the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC), followed a multi-sectoral, whole of society approach which consisted of engagements with key ministries, public and private sector stakeholders, academic and technical experts, civil society organizations, and vulnerable and marginalized groups.</p>
<p>The Government of Grenada is appreciative of the support provided by the Regional Collaboration Centre (RCC) St. George’s, and the NDC Partnership through its implementation partners Climate Analytics (CA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Organization of Eastern States (OECS), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and UNICEF.</p>
<p>Grenada is also committed to linking the NDC implementation to its national policy framework as expressed in the following policy documents and programmes, <em>inter alia</em>: National Climate Change Policy; National Sustainable Development Plan 2035; National Adaptation Plan (NAP); National Youth Policy; Gender Equality Policy and Action Plan; Green Climate Fund Country Programme; Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy; Basic Needs Trust Fund; Support for Education, Empowerment and Development; Climate Smart Cities and the Climate-Smart Rural Enterprise Development Programme.</p>
<h2 id="means-of-implementation">Means of Implementation </h2>
<p>To fully implement the mitigation measures contained in this NDC, Grenada will require grants and other concessional finance, support for capacity building and institutional strengthening and access to appropriate technologies. The indicative cost for Grenada’s identified NDC mitigation measures through 2030 is between $984.9 and $1,054.5 Million USD.</p>
<p>Grenada anticipates implementing the NDC through access to multilateral and bilateral support including through the Green Climate Fund, multilateral agencies, and bilateral arrangements with development partners. These funds will be used to leverage the limited national resources and technical capacities that are available for responding to climate change.</p>
<p>The NDC Partnership, the UNDP Climate Promise, UNICEF and the OECS Commission, will support the country in developing an implementation plan, a communications plan and a financing strategy with concrete measures and timelines for implementation, in an effort to transition the NDC target to real actions and emission reductions.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, given the limited domestic fiscal space and the economic constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government will adopt a comprehensive, holistic, and multi-sectoral approach to low-carbon development and climate resilience.</p>

<td rowspan="3">
(ii) <strong>Contextual matters</strong>, including, inter alia (among other things), as appropriate:
</td>
<td>
(a) <strong>National circumstances</strong>, such as geography, climate, economy, sustainable development, and poverty eradication;
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Geography:</strong> Grenada is a small island developing state located in the south-eastern Caribbean and is comprised of three islands, Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique. The combined land area is 345km<sup>2</sup> and is the southernmost of the Windward Islands. Grenada’s location coordinates are 12.07° N, 61.40° W.</p>
<p><strong>Climate:</strong> Grenada has a humid tropical marine climate with little seasonal or diurnal (daily) variation and a constant, strong ("trade") wind out of the east. This climate is affected mainly by the subtropical cyclone belt and the intertropical convergence zone. The location of these two meteorological systems varies in a cyclical pattern, and their movement gives a seasonal character to the weather. Rain tends to be showery and is distributed roughly into a drier season from January to May and a wetter season from June to December. Average temperature ranges between 28-33°C while rainfall ranges between 1000-4000 mm depending on the elevation and location with variations observed in the rainfall and drought due to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena.</p>
<p>Grenada is very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and is already experiencing climate change and its impacts. This is evidenced by increased average temperatures; variations in rainfall patterns with longer dry seasons and shorter rainy seasons resulting in increased incidence of drought; and sea level rise which has resulted in coastal degradation and intrusion of saline water into aquifers, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Economy:</strong> Grenada is classified as an upper middle-income country. Over the past two decades, the economy changed from being predominantly agriculture-based (production of sugar cane, cocoa, nutmeg, and banana) to services dominated (tourism, real estate, education, and construction). Grenada’s economy was buffeted during the 2000s due to Hurricane Ivan in 2004 (the damages inflicted by exceeded 200% of the country’s GDP); Hurricane Emily in 2005; the global food and oil price shock in 2008; the global financial crisis in 2009; and the extreme drought in 2010. Grenada made a notable recovery and between 2011-2018, the real GDP growth averaged at 3.7% and per capita income rose persistently. Even though Grenada has seen a consistent rise in real GDP and per capita growth, the impacts of Covid-19 threaten this growth going forward given, in most part, Grenada’s economy relies heavily on tourism and agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> The National Sustainable Development Plan is the anchor for Grenada’s development agenda and priorities over the period 2020-2035. It puts forward strategic priorities that have been identified to address crucial social, economic, environmental, and other development challenges. It envisions the workings of an economy and society that is premised on genuine partnership in which the public sector, private sector, civil society, and wider non-state actors share collective responsibility for Grenada’s sustainable development and plays complementary roles in the process of nation building. Grenada’s government is committed to social inclusion on the national level and is also striving for a more comprehensive involvement of the country’s diaspora.</p>
<p><strong>Poverty:</strong> The most recent snapshot of poverty in Grenada comes from the 2008 Country Poverty Assessment. 37.7% of the population was deemed to be poor and 2.4 % was deemed to be indigent. Children (persons aged 0-14) and youths (persons 15-24) accounted for 66.4% of the poor. Grenada is actively trying to eradicate poverty through its flagship poverty reduction programmes: Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) and Support for Education, Empowerment and Development (SEED) as well as the ClimateSmart Rural Enterprise Development Programme (SAEP).</p>
<p><strong>Inclusiveness:</strong> Grenada has anchored inclusivity as a cornerstone of its development process. The development and implementation of the successful 2013-2017 Structural Adjustment Process was led by a Committee of Social Partners chaired by the Prime Minister and which included stakeholders from the major societal groupings - private sector, NGO’s, trade unions, gender and youth, academia and faith based organizations. The development of national policies and strategies including the annual Budget includes processes to ensure that key stakeholders are consulted. The resulting policies therefore reflect the inputs from key stakeholder groupings and provide a framework that serves as a guide to the public sector, private sector, labour, and civil society.</p>

<td>
(b) <strong>Best practices</strong> and experience related to the preparation of the NDC;
</td>
<td>
<p>Grenada’s best practices in the preparation of the NDC are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Inclusiveness and Engagement:</strong> The process was characterized by its inclusiveness and consultative nature albeit in mostly virtual sessions due to Covid-19 and the need to adhere to the attendant protocols. All key stakeholders at both the governmental and non- governmental levels were fully involved and meaningfully engaged in major decision making over the NDC preparation period in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Linkages and Ownership:</strong> The NDC has been integrally linked and consistent with other relevant policies in particular, the National Climate Change Policy, The National Adaptation Plan, The National Sustainable Development Plan 2035 and the national planning and budgeting process. The NDC preparation was also characterized by high level ownership as senior government officials and non-government practitioners have endorsed the content of the NDC and expressed their commitment to its full implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Partnership:</strong> Through the NDC Partnership as the anchor, Grenada with the support of the Regional Collaboration Centre partnered with several regional and international organizations to determine a robust and practical NDC based on the latest science, methodologies, guidance, and applications.</p>
</td>

<tr class="odd">

<td>
(c) <strong>Other</strong> contextual aspirations and priorities acknowledged when joining the Paris Agreement.
</td>
<td>
<p>Grenada remains committed to linking the NDC implementation to the country’s Sustainable Development Goals agenda as reflected in Grenada’s Sustainable Development Plan 2020-2035, with a particular emphasis on development outcomes that contribute to building the resilience of most vulnerable groups. The government’s objective is to maximize the social co-benefits of the mitigation measures presented in the NDC.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Loss and Damage:</strong> Given Grenada’s vulnerability to negative sudden and slow onset processes and events such as hurricanes, floods, and environmental degradation,</p>
<p>Grenada will continue to build coherence with the NDC and NAP to comprehensively address loss and damage. This will include strengthening resilience to respond to impacts beyond the limits of adaptation and addressing human mobility and settlements.</p>
<p>In addition, the government acts within the guidelines of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 to protect development gains from the risk of disaster.</p>
<p><strong>Human Health:</strong> Implementing best available technologies could assist in mitigating factors that negatively impact respiratory health. Grenada is actively building capacity, developing policies, and implementing interventions to prevent morbidity, mortality and attain its SDGs. Key focus areas include strengthening capacity to address: climate change and health impacts; health emergencies and environmental threats and risks; and disaster management and risks.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong>: to ensure the future availability of quality, disaggregated, useable data, Grenada will continue efforts towards the development of a national data collection framework for long term collection and verification of data.</p>
<p>Grenada will adopt a holistic and multi-sectoral approach to low-carbon development and climate resilience, which encompasses education, health, food security, water and sanitation, housing and social protection and to ensure a resilient, inclusive, gender-sensitive, and peaceful society.</p>

</td>
<td colspan="2">
<p>The emissions reductions are a confirmation of the indicative ambitious 2030 NDC target submitted in 2016. This target remains the highest possible ambition that Grenada can achieve for this NDC target year. In fact, due to changing and unforeseen circumstances, the 2030 target represents a more significant effort on the part of Grenada than when it was initially proposed.</p>
<p>The achievement of the first NDC assumed that geothermal electricity would be available for the 2025 target. It is now clear that significant external support is required for the Geothermal programme for the 2030 target. Geothermal is currently the main contributor to Grenada’s mitigation efforts, however it is still in its exploratory phase. The existing feeder line network is believed to be able to incorporate a total of 15 MW of intermittent renewable energy. To meet the 2030 target, Grenada will require a rapid transition, involving energy conservation mechanisms and renewable energy deployment.</p>
<p>Vehicle sales have increased significantly than projected since the first NDC. In 2018, the number of registered vehicles was 51% higher than in 2010. As a result, the measures proposed in the first NDC for the transport sector (introduction of gasoline taxes, biofuel blends, and fuel efficiency standards) will be insufficient to achieve the 20% reductions anticipated from this sector by 2025, much less to achieve further reductions by 2030</p>
<p>While Grenada’s target is a base year target, and is not measured relative to future projections, these unforeseen factors will make it extremely difficult for the country to meet the targets set in 2016. As such, while Grenada will make every effort to meet the targets laid out in its NDC. It will not be feasible at this stage to commit to further emissions reductions beyond the 40% target.</p>
<p>To support the implementation of the NDC, Grenada developed an NDC Partnership Plan with the support of the NDC Partnership. Grenada will embark on a process for developing an implementation plan, communications plan and financing strategy with concrete measures and timelines for implementation to aid transition from NDC target to real action and emission reductions, with support as already indicated from the NDC Partnership, the UNDP Climate Promise and UNICEF.</p>
<p>Grenada anticipates implementing the NDC through access to multilateral and bilateral support including through the Green Climate Fund, multilateral agencies, and bilateral arrangements with development partners. These funds will be used to leverage the limited national resources and technical capacities that are available for combatting climate change.</p>
<p>The inclusion of F-gases and gender and youth considerations represent an expansion in scope relative to the first NDC.</p>
<p>Grenada will also develop a long-term low emissions development strategy.</p>

Grenada has the option under the Paris Agreement to prepare and communicate strategies, plans, and actions for low greenhouse gas emissions development that reflects its special circumstances. Notwithstanding, from its initial NDC, Grenada has chosen to demonstrate its commitment to fighting climate change and making its contributions to reducing emissions in the context of the Paris Agreement, by submitting an economy-wide base year emissions reduction target. In this same spirit and in line with <strong>Article 4 paragraphs 3 and 4</strong>, Grenada’s second NDC remains an economy-wide base year target.

Grenada considers the ambitious nature of the NDC to be in line with <strong>Article 2 paragraph 1</strong> (a) and <strong>Article 4, paragraph 1</strong> of the Paris Agreement. The emissions reduction target in the NDC is consistent with the level of ambition required to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as called for by the best available science and is also consistent with national efforts to achieve sustainable development and eradicate poverty.
