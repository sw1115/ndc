<p><strong>Long Term Decarbonisation Plans and mobilisation of Climate Finance</strong></p>
<p>In the Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) (2018-2050),<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> which is an economy-wide decarbonisation plan, Fiji has identified mitigation options for major sectors of the economy and has assessed the costs of these mitigation actions to inform sectoral plans and future NDCs. Fiji will operationalise its decarbonisation ambitions by implementing its NDC Investment Plan that is targeted towards creating a strong business case for mobilising new and additional climate finance.</p>
<p><strong>Creating an Enabling Environment for Decarbonisation Ambitions</strong></p>

<p>Consistent with the LEDS priorities, several important ongoing projects in the Agriculture, Waste and Forestry sectors are contributing to GHG emissions reductions, carbon sequestration, and enhanced climate resilience. Over the period of this NDC, Fiji will work on creating an enabling environment for sectorial decarbonisation and reporting initiatives through the enactment and operationalization of its Climate Change Bill in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Catalysing Sustainable Production and Consumption for holistic climate action</strong></p>
<p>Fiji has introduced a single-use plastic ban from 1 January 2020 that entails a ban on the importation, manufacture, distribution and use of single-use plastic bags. Commencing from 1 January 2021, Fiji will also impose a ban on the importation and export of Polystyrene products. From 1 August 2021, this will also entail a ban on the manufacture, distribution and use of polystyrene.

<p>The Climate Change and International Cooperation Division (CCICD) of the Ministry of Economy is the responsible national agency for addressing climate change policy issues in Fiji. The CCICD is guided by the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP)<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and works in collaboration with government agencies, non- governmental organizations, regional and international agencies and development partners. CCICD is responsible for preparing national reports to the UNFCCC in cooperation with other national stakeholders. It was also the lead agency for preparing and submitting the initial NDC under the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The Low Emission Development Strategy Steering Committee is a coordination mechanism established for the development of Fiji’s Low Emissions Development Strategy. It comprises of Senior Government Officials from relevant Ministries and Public Utilities. The Committee was convened to validate this NDC Update and is envisaged to be an established body under Fiji’s Climate Change Bill to oversee the NDC revision process as part of the institutional arrangement for current and future NDCs.</p>
<p>This NDC Update was prepared by taking into account Fiji’s national circumstances, challenges and opportunities for mitigation. In the planning phase from 2015 to 2020, Fiji has developed its NDC Implementation Roadmap, the Low Emission Development Strategy and the National Adaptation Plan through inclusive stake-holder consultations and is now in the process of finalising the NDC Investment Plan and Projects Pipeline, Fiji’s Technology Needs Assessment, SDG7 Roadmap and the review of the Fiji Energy Policy in collaboration and consultation with industry stakeholders, academic experts, local NGO groups, and technical consultants. These key stakeholders provide additional inputs on available and future technologies for long term mitigation and adaptation actions in Fiji.</p>
<p>Gender considerations: The NDC planning process was guided by the principle of gender-responsiveness as articulated in the National Climate Change Policy. The Policy emphasises and makes a specific call to ensure that all approaches and methods for adaptation and mitigation are guided by the consideration of gender issues, support improved gender-balance in both the decisionmaking processes and related implementation arrangements, promote gender-equitable benefits, and achieve outcomes which ensure that gender is a key consideration when programming finance and capacity-building.</p>

<p>Fiji is a tropical island country located in the Oceania in the South Pacific Ocean and comprises of 332 islands scattered across roughly 1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> of ocean that is declared as its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Among its vast archipelago, Viti Levu (10,429 km<sup>2</sup>) and Vanua Levu (5,556 km<sup>2</sup>) are the two largest islands and major inhabited regions, comprising of 87% of the land area (18,333 km<sup>2</sup>). The total estimated population as per the 2017 National Census is 884,887 of which 55.9% reside in urban areas and 44.1% in rural areas. These islands are volcanic in nature and are mostly dominated by steep mountainous terrains. Fiji is located between 15 and 22 South latitude and 175 East and 178 West longitudes and thus experiences an oceanic tropical climate where the daily average temperature is constant at about 25 degrees Celsius. The country has an estimated GDP of US$5.5 billion, with US$5,800 per capita GDP wherein tourism is the most important sector and accounts for more than 25% of the GDP.</p>
<p>The country has faced adverse climate impacts, such as stronger storms, rising seas, and changing weather patterns. Fiji was struck by the Southern Hemisphere’s strongest-ever storm, Cyclone Winston, in 2016, which resulted in estimated damages amounting to US$0.9 billion, including US$0.6 billion in damage and US$0.3 billion in losses representing one third of the total GDP (Republic of Fiji, 2020). Due to the COVID-19 crisis,</p>
<p>Fiji’s economy is expected to shrink by approximately 20% in 2020, with the tourism sector facing the full brunt of the pandemic-induced travel restrictions. As a result, around 118,500 people are jobless.</p></td>

<p>Fiji has made steady progress in putting in place appropriate strategies for meeting its adaptation needs and mitigation ambitions, however significant challenges remain in mobilising the resources necessary to implement its planned adaptation and mitigation measures. As a small island developing state, Fiji has limited financial resources for climate actions, a situation exacerbated by the significant economic losses Fiji incurs through sudden onsets of climate change such as cyclones and storm surges. Hence the scale of investments needed for necessary adaptation and mitigation measures outpaces Fiji’s current ability to finance the transformational change envisioned for a sustainable, inclusive, resilient and low carbon economy.</th>

To achieve this core objective, the Low Emission Development Strategy has elaborated four possible low emission scenarios for each sector including electricity and other energy use, land transport, domestic maritime transport, domestic air transport, agriculture, forestry and other land use, coastal wetlands and waste. The Strategy estimates that Fiji’s emissions would more than double under the “business as usual (BAU)” unconditional scenario, grow incrementally under the BAU Conditional scenario, drop by nearly 31% under the High Ambition scenario and achieve net negative emissions during the year 2041 under the Very High Ambition scenario.

<h2>Fiji’s Adaptation Component of the NDC Update</h2>
<h3><em>2.1 Background</em></h3>
<p>According to the IPCC Special Report, the <em>Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate</em>, which was released in 2019, climate adaptation is expected to be significantly more challenging for ecosystems, food and health systems at 2°C of global warming above the pre-industrial age than for 1.5°C (medium confidence). Even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C, vulnerable regions, including the Small Island Developing States, are projected to experience a multitude of interrelated climate risks, resulting in loss of livelihoods, food insecurity and largescale population displacement. Fiji recognises this reality, as it lies on the front line of adverse climate change impacts and will be facing some of the most severe climate-related challenges in the coming decade. These range from prolonged droughts, changes in the hydrological cycle resulting in intense floods, and extreme weather events, to rising sea levels and its resultant saltwater intrusion and loss of habitable land. This has already led to partial and complete relocation of six climate vulnerable communities, with many more regions in the country being threatened by similar consequences.</p>
<p>The impacts of climate change are affecting all aspects of life for Fijians - the environment, economy, social development, as well as cultural practices and traditional ways of life. Fiji is facing loss and degradation of vital ecosystems and natural resources, including its coral reefs, coasts and catchments, on which key sectors of its economy such as agriculture and fisheries are dependant. Further, its critical infrastructure- including electricity and water stations, schools and hospitals – are frequently damaged by the increasing extreme weather events, which are impacting the social well-being, employment and livelihoods of the Fijian people.</p>
<h3><em>2.2 Quantifying Climate Vulnerability and Adaptation Needs</em></h3>


<h4>Fiji’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment </h4>

<p>The CVA provides a blueprint for urgent climate actions and quantifies the resources needed to climate-proof Fiji.</p>
<p>To mitigate climate impact, the CVA proposed 125 interventions in five key areas, aligned with Fiji’s development plans and goals, to improve the resilience capacity of the country.</p>
<p>These focus areas were integrated to be addressed under the National Adaptation Plan through measures such as risk-informed land use planning and housing policies, developing resilient infrastructure, climate smart adaptation in agriculture and fishery sectors, environmental protection and conservation of key ecosystems and the protection of vulnerable population through targeted gender interventions.</p>

<p>In 2017, Fiji completed its comprehensive Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA)<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> of the country and economy, on the basis of which it identified priority focus areas to be addressed through climate adaptation measures. The CVA projected that by 2050, over 6.5 per cent of Fiji’s GDP could be lost due to tropical cyclones and floods, with the number of people being pushed into poverty every year increasing by 25 per cent. In addition, long-term climate change will affect health in Fiji, with impacts including rise in vector-borne diseases (such as dengue fever), water-borne diseases and non-communicable diseases which are sensitive to temperatures (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases).</p>
<p>To build the requisite domestic capacity, Fiji is committed to taking proactive steps to reduce its vulnerability and enhance the resilience of its communities, environment and economy. This is being done through developing policies, institutions and budgetary systems for mobilising resources toward climate change and disaster risk management, including a focus on developing domestic capacities and on transparent communication and robust monitoring systems so as to ensure equity, justice, inclusion, transparency, and accountability in all climate actions.</p>
<h3><em>2.3 Holistic Approach to Mainstreaming Adaptation and Resilience</em></h3>
<h4>Fiji’s National Adaptation Plan </h4>

<p>The NAP contains 160 adaptation measures to be prioritised over its five-year time frame, split across a total of 10 components.</p>
<p>This entails five systems components which are required to instigate a paradigm shift and create an enabling environment for increase investment flows to adaptation and an addtional five sectoral components which are actions for addressing the vulnerability of society and the economy to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Under its NAP process, Fiji envisions three additional stages to ensure effectiveness of its planned adaptations measures. These are the development of a monitoring and evaluation system, the development of a communication plan and the forumaltion of a financing plan.</p>

<p>Fiji’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which was launched in 2018, focuses on shifting existing and future development planning processes towards a holistic pathway of climate-resilience. The initiatives encapsulated in the NAP, are well aligned with the requirements for enhancing adaptation actions in Fiji’s NDC, especially as these were based on the insights garnered from the CVA, which in its turn entailed a comprehensive mapping of on-the-ground issues. Further, the NAP was the result of extensive inter-ministerial deliberations with multistakeholder engagements and inputs of technical experts from the private sector, civil society and academia, and sub-national Government representatives, making the measures listed under it robust and with potential of being effectively implemented.</p>
<h3><em>2.4 Fiji’s Commitment to Adaptation Actions with Mitigation Co-benefits</em></h3>
<p>Fiji’s inherent vulnerability to climate induced disaster is exacerbated by the growing impacts of climate change which threaten to negate years of development progress.</p>
<p>Transitioning towards a low carbon economy and achieving the decarbonisation targets of this NDC Update will require substantial resource mobilisation for climate adaptation. Investments in climate adaptation now will not only help ensure that investments in renewable solutions are sustainable and resilient to climate adversities but also lower the inherently high risk of doing business in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In this regard, Fiji commits to the following adaptation actions in this NDC Update:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Climate change is a shared responsibility and Fiji will make efforts to mobilize domestic and new investments toward sustainable development pathways by following an evaluation and learning-based approach, with a focus on building synergies and bridging its internal capacity and resource gaps.</li>
<li>Fiji will promote sustainable and resilient development by enabling key stakeholders at the national and sub-national levels and strengthening the role of its local government bodies to make informed decisions regarding the use of natural resources.</li>
<li>To enhance the adaptive capacity of its economy and communities, Fiji will endeavour to produce and make accessible reliable, robust, and updated climate information, including projections for impacts of climate change.</li>
<li>Fiji will take measures to ensure that public infrastructure is resilient to cyclones and floods, prioritizing nature-based economically viable solutions, and developing future infrastructure and building projects while keeping in mind the effects of climate change.</li>
<li>Fiji will undertake measures under a comprehensive and integrated water resource management approach to conserve and enhance the productivity of its freshwater sources and ensure their judicious and equitable use.</li>
<li>Fiji will prioritize the conservation and protection of its marine biodiversity and critical ocean ecosystems. This would include measures for promoting sustainable fishing practices, coastal protection, preservation, and enhancement of its mangroves, and engaging with coastal communities to promote sustainable practices and livelihoods.</li>
<li>Fiji will ensure that comprehensive multi-hazard and risk assessments are conducted to inform the planning and development of climate-resilient human settlements.</li>
<li>Fiji will focus on mitigating and protecting all Fijians from the worst effects of natural disasters by ensuring that the housing stock (both existing and future) is strengthened to withstand extreme events and that climate-resilient upgrading of informal settlements is prioritised.</li>
<li>Fiji commits to strengthening the resilience of its agriculture sector to ensure national food security, and to diversify the dependence on the sector by promoting sustainable livelihood opportunities.</li>
<li>Fiji will imbibe its traditional values of respecting and living within nature’s limits, in its future development plans in the context of its financial, technical, and social capacities, and develop robust legislative measures to protect and conserve the vulnerable species and ecosystems.</li>
<li>Fiji will take appropriate steps to protect its social infrastructure against climate change and prioritise gender, disability, and the needs of the children and elderly in disaster management and in climate action.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>3. CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Fiji has successfully analysed the lessons learned since the submission of the first NDC and has explored a number of options for enhancement, with an eye towards ambition.</p>
<p>Fiji has involved various stakeholders in comprehensively designing its mitigation plans and adaptation measures, along with exploring opportunities in new sectors such as oceans, nature-based solutions linked to biodiversity protection, and health, among others.</p>
<p>However, the brutal economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has placed serious fiscal pressure on Fiji. As a direct result, Fiji’s ability to fund sustainable development, including resilience-building and the pursuit of carbon neutrality, has been severely handicapped.</p>
<p>The strategy, however, is clear. Fiji has managed to outlay a suite of comprehensive mitigation and adaptation measures across multiple sectors which now require large scale resource mobilisation, rapid technology transfer to lower costs and increase viability; robust monitoring and evaluation systems to enable continuous improvements and dynamic communications plans to build climate awareness for the full implementation of its necessary climate adaptation plans and mitigation ambitions.</p>
