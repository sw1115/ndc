<h1><strong>NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS OF PERU</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>UPDATE REPORT PERIOD 2021 - 2030</strong></h2>
<p>This update of the <strong>Nationally Determined Contributions of Peru (NDC)</strong> was approved on December 16, 2020 by the High Level Commission on Climate Change, which is made up of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, which is chaired by 13 ministries of State, and representatives of the National Center for Strategic Planning, the National Assembly of Regional Governments and the Association of Municipalities of Peru. It also had the technical support of the NDC Working Group.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Background</strong></h2>
<p>In 2014, the Twentieth Conference of the Parties (COP 20) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Lima, Peru, with the mission of facilitating the space for discussion to reach an agreement binding global climate. In this context and under the Peruvian Presidency, the adoption of the "Lima Call for Climate Action" was achieved, which marked a milestone towards COP 21, to be held in Paris, France, and where a new agreement would be approved in the UNFCCC framework. Likewise, during COP 20 it was stressed that this future agreement should reflect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capacities (CBDR-RC), understood in the light of different national circumstances.</p>
<p>The achievements obtained during COP 20 also include: i) the reinforcement of the invitation and the definition of the deadline for each of the Parties to communicate to the UNFCCC secretariat their planned and nationally determined contributions (subsequently known as iNDC, for its acronym in English); ii) inviting Parties to consider including adaptation initiatives or components in their iNDCs; iii) the incentive for each country to be more ambitious in formulating its national contributions; and, iv) the request to the UNFCCC secretariat to prepare, no later than November 1, 2015, a synthesis report containing the aggregate effect of the iNDCs that have been submitted by the Parties up to October 1. of 2015<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In this way, in order to comply with the agreements and decisions of COP 19 (in Warsaw, Poland), ratified during COP 20, the Peruvian State began the process of formulating its Anticipated and Determined Contributions at the National Level (iNDC) in the second semester of 2014. To this end, the State established the temporary Multisectoral Commission in charge of preparing the technical report that should contain the Peruvian proposal of the Estimated and Determined Contributions at National Level<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup><u>2</u></sup></a>, carried out between April and September 2015. The Ministry of the Environment of Peru, in its capacity as Presidency and Technical Secretariat of this Commission, was in charge of preparing the Technical Report that served as the basis for the preparation of the Report of the country's iNDC proposal<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, elevated to the UNFCCC in September 2015. This national proposal had heightened ambition because, in addition to formulating goals for the mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG), it also communicated national efforts on adaptation to climate change.</p>
<blockquote><strong><p>The Paris Agreement states that all Parties must make and communicate ambitious efforts related to their Nationally Determined Contributions.</p></strong></blockquote>
<p>Later, already during COP 21 and based on the actions and negotiations carried out within the framework of the Lima-Paris Agenda, 195 nations unanimously approved an unprecedented global agreement to combat climate change and promote measures and investments for the future. low carbon, resilient and sustainable, the so-called Paris Agreement. The objectives of the Agreement are to keep the global average temperature rise below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels and to continue efforts to limit this temperature rise to 1.5°C. Additionally, the Agreement proposes increasing the capacity to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and promoting climate resilience and development with low GHG emissions, as well as placing financial flows at a level compatible with a path that leads to development. under these characteristics<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement states that all Parties must make and communicate ambitious efforts related to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which constitute the global response to climate change. In addition, it indicates that the Parties intend to achieve that global GHG emissions reach their peak as soon as possible, taking into account that developing countries will take longer to achieve this, and that, from that moment, GHG emissions should be reduced rapidly, in accordance with the best available scientific information on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. Thus, each of the Parties must increase the ambition of their national contributions in successive communications to the Convention, in periods of five years, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their respective capacities, in light of the different national circumstances.</p>
<p>A few months before its entry into force, on November 4, 2016, the Peruvian State was the first Spanish-American country to ratify the Paris Agreement<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. In this way, after the entry into force of the Agreement, the iNDCs presented by Peru to the UNFCCC in 2015 became known as NDCs and became our first national contributions to global efforts to reduce GHG emissions and adaptation to climate change.</p>
<p>During this period of updating the NDCs of Peru, the Peruvian State created the Multisectoral Working Group of a temporary nature in charge of generating technical information to guide the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (GTM-NDC)<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>, which had a mandate with a total duration of 21 months<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. The GTM-NDC process was based on a work of articulation and multisectoral involvement between the government sectors that are responsible for the implementation of the country's NDC, as well as those that ensure the incorporation of cross-cutting approaches on gender, interculturality and intergenerational. Additionally, for the success of this process, a not only multisectoral but also multilevel and multiactor approach was necessary, due to the need to involve, attend and commit all spheres of the State, regional and local governments; as well as a great diversity of non-state actors, such as indigenous or native peoples, the private sector, youth and the general public. The participatory process "Let's talk about the NDC"<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>, instituted during this period, was and continues to be key to this process.</p>
<p>In this way, and in accordance with the successive decisions in the framework of the UNFCCC, the process for updating Peru's NDCs to the year 2030 is characterized by a commitment to increasing ambition, both in mitigation and adaptation; for an effort to provide the necessary information for the purposes of clarity, transparency and understanding; by an explicit commitment to guarantee methodological consistency; for the strengthening of regulations for the integral management of climate change; for its articulation with the other processes undertaken by the State to achieve the development of the country, especially in a context characterized by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic reactivation; and for having carried out a participatory multi-level and multi-stakeholder process in order to guarantee the success of the process of formulation, updating, and implementation of the country's national contributions.</p>
<h2><strong>2 The update of the Nationally Determined Contributions of Peru for the period 2021 2030</h2>
<h3>2.1. Peru's commitment to greenhouse gas mitigation</h3>
<p>The Peruvian State undertakes that its net greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed 208.8 MtCO2eq in 2030 (unconditional target)<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>. Additionally, the Peruvian State considers that greenhouse gas emissions could reach a maximum level of 179.0 MtCO2eq<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> depending on the availability of international external financing and the existence of favorable conditions (conditional goal).</p>
<h3>2.2. Peru's commitment to climate change adaptation</strong></h3>
<p>The Peruvian State undertakes to contribute to the global goal of adaptation by reducing damages, possible alterations and the consequent current and future losses, generated by the dangers associated with climate change on populations and their livelihoods; on basins, ecosystems and territories; and on the infrastructure, goods and services of the country. In turn, it contemplates taking advantage of the opportunities that climate change offers for sustainable and climate-responsible development.</p>
<blockquote><strong><p>The Peruvian State aspires for greenhouse gas emissions to reach a maximum level of 179.0 MtCO2eq in the year 2030.</p></strong></blockquote>
<h2>3 Additional information on Peru's NDCs</strong></h2>
<h3>3.1. Characteristics of NDCs for greenhouse gas mitigation</h3>
<p>Peru formulates the update of its NDCs for GHG mitigation considering absolute goals that should have an impact on our economy as a whole. These efforts thus reflect the ambitious commitment acquired by the Peruvian State and clearly and consistently manifest its vision of decarbonization in the long term. For this, our national contributions set an unconditional goal of limiting our GHG emissions to a maximum level of 208.8 MtCO2eq. Additionally, it incorporates a component conditioned to the availability of international financing, through which it is proposed to limit our emissions to a level of 179.0 MtCO2eq.</p>
<p>To meet this goal, Peru establishes the implementation of mitigation measures formulated in all emission sectors that make up the mitigation NDCs. In this sense, Article 16 of the Framework Law on Climate Change of Peru (LMCC)<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> indicates that the State, in its three levels of government, in an articulated and participatory manner designs and implements programs, projects and activities aimed at reducing GHG emissions, carbon sequestration and increased sinks. Likewise, according to the Regulation of the LMCC<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, these mitigation measures are actions taken by state and non-state actors that seek to reduce GHG emissions and increase GHG removals, and which also contribute to long-term low-carbon development. In this way, the Peruvian State has worked in recent years to strengthen its institutional framework; to guarantee participation spaces for non-state actors in the processes of design of adaptation and mitigation measures, facilitating spaces for articulation and agreement between the various state and non-state actors linked to the integral management of climate change; and to strengthen and provide legitimacy to the management of GHG emissions and reductions in Peru. All of this lays a solid foundation for implementation, , monitoring and fulfillment of our national contributions.</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Target year</h4>
<p>The target year considered for Peru's NDCs is 2030.</p>
<h4>3.1.2. Quantifiable information in the target year</h4>
<p>Peru's commitment to GHG mitigation sets absolute emission targets for the year 2030, the so-called unconditional target; and, additionally, an emissions target conditional on international external financing (Table 1).</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Period of application</strong></h4>
<p>The application of our NDC corresponds to the period between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2030<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h4>3.1.4. Scope and coverage</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scope:</strong> National.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GHGs considered:</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sectors:</strong> The emission sectors included in the INGEI are considered. The sectors are: i) Energy; ii) Industrial Processes and Product Use (PIUP); iii) Waste; iv) Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF); and, v) Agriculture. It is worth mentioning that all the sectors considered in our NDCs presented in 2015 are maintained for this update period.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>3.1.5. Methodological approach and assumptions considered</h4>
<p>The Peruvian NDCs for mitigation have been built from the analysis of our GHG emissions sectors, which included the projection of sectoral scenarios. These scenarios were determined taking into consideration the dynamics of each of the sectors and taking as a basis the information from the sources and categories reported in our INGEI. In turn, the national INGEIs have been prepared following the guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of 2006 and using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values ​​provided by the IPCC itself in its Second Assessment Report (CH4: 21 and N2O: 310)<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p>
<h4>3.1.6. Voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement</h4>
<p>Peru anticipates its participation in the cooperative approaches of the Paris Agreement. To do this, it is preparing the necessary domestic conditions, such as institutional arrangements, regulations and procedures, which, once applied, contribute to increasing the ambition of our NDCs, promote sustainable development and guarantee environmental integrity. In this sense, robust and transparent accounting must be applied to ensure the absence of double counting.</p>
<h3>3.2 Characteristics of NDCs for adaptation to climate change</h3>
<p>From the point of view of international commitments, Peru has been a promoter and pioneer in the incorporation of the adaptation component to climate change as part of national contributions since COP 20, held in Lima, Peru. In this regard, the country is committed to contributing to the global goal of adaptation to climate change established in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, which consists of increasing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change with a view to to contribute to sustainable development and achieve an adequate adaptation response in the context of the objective of limiting the increase in temperature mentioned in Article 2 of the same Agreement. Additionally, in paragraphs 10 and 11 of Article 7, it is recommended that each of the Parties should present and update a communication on adaptation to climate change<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Following these recommendations and with the objective of complying with the international commitments assumed by Peru, the State has formulated its NDCs for adaptation to climate change. These results have been obtained through participatory processes (Let's talk about the NDC) and the production of information carried out throughout the national territory and which have brought together a great diversity of state and non-state actors. In this way, the country has made a significant effort to build a model for adaptation to climate change based on risk management in the face of the effects of climate change, which contributes to planning and implementing actions aimed at guiding the reduction of the exposure and vulnerability, as well as to increase the adaptive capacity of the different vulnerable subjects of the country to the dangers associated with climate change<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. This model also considers a prospective and long-term look based on the best available science.</p>
<h4>3.2.1. Risks and opportunities before the effects of climate change in Peru</strong></h4>
<p>Climate change is an incontestable global phenomenon and its consequences affect, to a greater or lesser extent, the entire world population, their livelihoods and security. Due to structural socio-environmental factors strongly influenced by poverty and the various social asymmetries characteristic of the country, which are added to the particular vulnerability of our various ecosystems, Peru is one of the countries most vulnerable to these effects. According to the current National Strategy for Climate Change<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, Peru has seven of the nine characteristics recognized by the UNFCCC to qualify countries particularly vulnerable to climate change: i) low-lying coastal areas; ii) arid and semi-arid zones; iii) areas exposed to floods, droughts and desertification; iv) fragile mountain ecosystems; v) disaster-prone areas; vi) areas with high urban air pollution; and, vii) present an economy dependent on the income generated by the production and use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Alterations in the climate and the increase in the frequency and intensity of the dangers associated with climate change affect our country through the increase in the average temperature, the loss of glacial surface, the incidence of prolonged droughts, the greater frequency of intense rains that cause landslides and floods, among others. These dangers, in turn, impact on the various population groups; in ecosystems and their ecosystem services; in the national productive structure; and in the economic and social infrastructure, which causes the deterioration of the well-being of the population. Many of these effects can already be observed and will continue in the medium and long term. These multiple effects and impacts of climate change in our territory demand that the State, at its different levels of government, academia, private economic agents and civil society in general establish effective measures aimed at avoiding or reducing damage, possible alterations and the consequent current and future losses generated by the dangers associated with climate change on populations and their livelihoods ; on basins and territories; and on the infrastructure, goods and services of the country. In this way and as a consequence of this situation, it is necessary to face the challenge of generating public policies that allow social inclusion and that promote adaptation to climate change and the use of the opportunities it offers. the possible alterations and the consequent current and future losses generated by the dangers associated with climate change on populations and their livelihoods; on basins and territories; and on the infrastructure, goods and services of the country. In this way and as a consequence of this situation, it is necessary to face the challenge of generating public policies that allow social inclusion and that promote adaptation to climate change and the use of the opportunities it offers. the possible alterations and the consequent current and future losses generated by the dangers associated with climate change on populations and their livelihoods; on basins and territories; and on the infrastructure, goods and services of the country. In this way and as a consequence of this situation, it is necessary to face the challenge of generating public policies that allow social inclusion and that promote adaptation to climate change and the use of the opportunities it offers.</p>
<blockquote><strong><p>Additionally, two new thematic areas are considered in adaptation with respect to our NDCs presented in 2015, which will contribute to the country's goal: Tourism and Transportation.</p></strong></blockquote>
<p>According to the IPCC guidelines<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>, the first measure of adaptation to climate change should consist of reducing vulnerability and exposure to current climate variability. In this way, the integration of adaptation in planning, its inclusion in policy design and its incorporation in decision-making processes can promote synergies with development, disaster risk reduction, and biodiversity conservation. and the fight against desertification.</p>
<p>In this sense, Article 15 of the LMCC indicates that the State, in its three levels of government, in an articulated and participatory manner, adopts adaptation measures and the use of opportunities in the face of climate change. Likewise, the LMCC Regulation defines adaptation measures as interventions planned by state and non-state actors, consisting of actions, practices, technologies and necessary services aimed at reducing or avoiding severe alterations, losses and damages, triggered by hazards associated with climate change in populations, livelihoods, ecosystems, basins, territories, infrastructure, goods and services, among others; as well as taking advantage of the opportunities that climate change offers. Thus, from the perspective of the Peruvian State, adaptation to climate change is a priority if it is to achieve sustainable and resilient development.</p>
<h4>3.2.2. Priorities for adaptation to climate change in Peru</h4>
<p>Peru's NDCs for adaptation to climate change seek to reduce and/or avoid current and future damages, losses and alterations triggered by the dangers of climate change in the livelihoods of populations, ecosystems, basins, territories, infrastructure, goods and/or services, among others; as well as, take advantage of the opportunities that climate change offers for sustainable and resilient development.</p>
<h4>3.2.3. Target year</strong></h4>
<p>The target year considered for Peru's NDCs is 2030.</p>
<h4>3.2.4. Application period</strong></h4>
<p>The application of our NDCs corresponds to the period between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2030.</p>
<h4>3.2.5. Scope and coverage</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scope:</strong> National</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prioritized thematic areas:</strong> Objectives and adaptation measures are established in five prioritized thematic areas: i) Agriculture; ii) Forests; iii) Fishing and aquaculture; iv) Health; and, v) Water; which also include the incorporation of transversal approaches. Additionally, two new thematic areas are considered with respect to our NDCs presented in 2015, which will contribute to the country's goal: i) Tourism and ii) Transportation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The objectives proposed for each of the prioritized thematic areas seek to achieve adaptation in the long term (2050) because they are articulated with the process of construction of the National Adaptation Plan<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>, which will be the guiding document for adaptation to climate change in Peru. In this way, and to reach this horizon, adaptation measures must be specified that, once implemented, will contribute to achieving the country's commitment. The NDC adaptation measures have a time horizon of implementation to 2030, under that perspective there are indicators and goals in the short (2021) and medium (2025) terms, which will allow, in turn, to monitor and evaluate the level compliance and advancement of the priority objective for adaptation in Peru within the framework of our national contributions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data sources:</strong> Multi-stakeholder participatory processes, roadmaps for the implementation of adaptation measures developed by the competent government sectors, risk analysis of the effects of climate change, climate scenarios and climate risk for the country.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>3.2.6. Risk management model for the effects of climate change for adaptation in Peru</h4>
<p>Finally, to achieve our adaptation goal, the Peruvian State has developed a model that allows risk management in the face of the effects of climate change. In this sense, risk management in the face of the effects of climate change, according to the LMCC Regulation, is focused on reducing, preventing or avoiding current and potential damages, as well as severe alterations generated by dangers associated with climate change and In this way, also avoid the losses that could occur due to their cause, in accordance with the established regulations of the National Disaster Risk Management System. To do this, a cyclical model is established, consisting of four phases: i) risk analysis of the effects of climate change; ii) the formulation and systematization of the adaptation measures adopted; iii) the development of an implementation strategy for adaptation measures; and, iv) monitoring and evaluation to measure progress in the implementation of adaptation measures. It is based on this model of risk management for adaptation that Peru has developed the update of its NDCs for adaptation to climate change, 25% of which correspond to disaster risk reduction measures.</p>
<h2>4 Improvements to the National Contributions presented in 2015</h2>
<h3>4.1 Improvements to GHG mitigation NDCs</strong></h3>
<p>As a result of updating our first NDCs, presented to the UNFCCC Secretariat in September 2015<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>, Peru has established a clear and ambitious commitment as part of the global response to climate change. In this sense, the improvements made with respect to the NDCs regarding GHG mitigation presented in 2015 are expressed through: i) a lower level of emissions in the target year; ii) greater methodological robustness; and, iii) transparency for its measurement and reporting.</p>
<p>Two key actions have been developed to improve our NDCs. The first refers to the change of focus in the formulation of the goals, which have gone from being relative goals, estimated based on a <em>Business as Usual</em> (BaU) scenario, to being absolute goals, which means establishing a maximum emission limit. in the target year, determined through a fixed value, in units of CO2eq. This change in focus allows you to present a clear goal, ruling out the level of uncertainty that comes with using a benchmark to measure your progress. In this way, the use of an absolute emissions target allows us to more clearly reflect our contribution to the global mitigation target.</p>
<p>The second key action refers to the determination of the magnitude of the goals, both in their unconditional and conditional components. For this, the target values ​​in absolute terms have been determined from the increase in the magnitude of the reductions considered in relation to the BaU scenario, going from 20% to 30% of reductions in 2030, for the unconditional target; and from 30% to 40%, for the conditional goal.</p>
<p>The goals proposed in this update establish more stringent limits with respect to our NDCs presented in 2015<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>. Table 2 compares the estimated values ​​of the NDC goals presented in 2015 and the updated goals during this period.</p>

</table>
<p>It is important to indicate that the new goals presented by Peru are supported by sectoral roadmaps developed during this updating period in a multisectoral, multilevel and multiactor process led by the State. These roadmaps are intended to guide the implementation of measures that lead to the fulfillment of our goals; strengthen the institutional framework built; and, guaranteeing the articulation between the various government sectors that have the implementation of the measures under their jurisdiction, the government sectors that ensure the incorporation of cross-cutting gender, intercultural and intergenerational approaches, non-state actors and citizens in general.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Peruvian State has made an effort to increase the methodological robustness of the INGEI, consolidating it as the main tool for the formulation of the NDC and for measuring progress in its implementation. It is important to mention that, in recent years and as a result of the multisectoral work developed by the country, profound improvements have been made in the INGEI, under the management of INFOCARBONO<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>. The INFOCARBON is an institutional arrangement that allows the competent government sectors to report their GHG emissions and removals with a view to having a transparent, exhaustive, coherent, comparable and accurate INGEI. The latter has allowed the incorporation of methodological improvements that reduce the level of uncertainty and help to represent our emissions more accurately.</p>
<p>In this sense, for this update of our NDCs, Peru has improved the INGEI through the standardized use of the 2006 IPCC guide for all emission sectors and their categories. Additionally, INGEI has considered new categories of sources and sinks, as well as increased the scope of some of those already included.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) mechanisms of mitigation measures are the main instrument for monitoring them and are essential to assess their progress, plan their management and know the reduction of GHG emissions. In this way, it will be possible to take corrective actions in time and generate information that will provide clarity in monitoring the progress of the NDCs, fostering the confidence of the information. The sectoral authorities, which formulate or promote mitigation measures, are responsible for monitoring the measures that contribute to mitigation NDCs.</p>
<p>Finally, the adoption of absolute targets establishes a clear commitment and in accordance with the global response to climate change, which considers achieving global net emissions equal to zero from the second half of this century. With this measure taken by the Peruvian State, uncertainties regarding the magnitude of our NDC generated by the choice of a relative goal are discarded. In this way, our absolute goal constitutes an exact reference for monitoring, progress reporting and compliance with our mitigation NDCs, in compliance with the commitments assumed by the country under the Paris Agreement regarding the transparency framework.</p>
<h3>4.2 Improvements in the NDC for adaptation to climate change</h3>
<p>As part of our first NDCs, Peru presented five priority sectors or systems for adaptation to climate change in the country: i) Water (Water Resources); ii) Agriculture; iii) Fishing; iv) Forests; and, v) Health. These priority sectors or systems were identified during the process of formulating our first national contributions on the basis of the scientific information available at that time, in addition to being the product of the review of reference information on the processes of formulation of management instruments and of planning, as well as consultations with the competent government sectors, sub-national authorities and civil society. Additionally, for each of these prioritized sectors or systems, a scope, goals and intermediate objectives were determined<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Since then, the effort that Peru has made as part of the process of updating our NDCs has been considerable and is consistent with the country's historical leadership in adaptation to climate change. In this way, the improvements made on the NDCs presented in 2015 are expressed through: i) the establishment of a conceptual framework for risk management associated with climate change, through which the problem has been identified and the priority objective for adaptation in the country; ii) the formulation of specific adaptation measures, which have indicators, goals and implementation deadlines, for each of the prioritized thematic areas presented in 2015; iii) the effort to have gone beyond the diagnosis, produced information, generated scenarios, identified the risks to which vulnerable subjects or groups are and will potentially be exposed, as a permanent process of continuous improvement, for each of the prioritized thematic areas; and, iv) the identification of new priority thematic areas, on which concrete measures, indicators and goals will be identified.</p>
<p>Here it is important to indicate that the generation of current and future risk scenarios for the effects of climate change at the national level for each thematic area, subject to analysis and prioritized danger, has been of utmost importance for the definition of the country's ambition in the matter adaptation to climate change. This, in turn, demonstrates the country's interest in the production of scientific and technical information aimed at guiding decision-making and evaluating the results obtained. In other words, throughout this process of updating our NDCs and within the framework of the global goal for adaptation, Peru has worked on the formulation of measures aimed at reducing vulnerability and risks to the effects of climate change, by strengthening the basic information and the participation of the various actors in society through joint and consensual work.</p>
<blockquote><strong><p>The new goals presented by Peru are supported by sectoral roadmaps developed during this update period in a multisectoral, multilevel and multistakeholder process led by the State.</p></strong></blockquote>
<h2>5. Planning processes for the implementation of the NDC of Peru</h2>
<p>Due to its geographical, ecological and social characteristics, Peru is one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change. During the last decades, aware of this reality and based on various national and international historical processes, the Peruvian State has designed and initiated the implementation of a comprehensive management of climate change. In this context and in parallel to the process of updating our NDCs, the Peruvian State has strengthened the regulations and institutional framework that support the integral management of climate change in the country. In this sense, the promulgation of Law No. 30754, Framework Law on Climate Change, in April 2018, and the approval of its Regulations, in December 2019, were a turning point.</p>
<p>The LMCC aims to establish the principles, approaches and general provisions for the participatory, transparent and comprehensive management of climate change, in order to reduce the vulnerability of the country, take advantage of the opportunities of low carbon growth and comply with the international commitments assumed by the State before the UNFCCC. This Law is important because it establishes clear mandates and because it defines specific guidelines for government sectors, regional governments, local governments, and non-state actors. The main elements included in the LMCC are: i) articulation with the international context; ii) incorporation of climate change in national development planning; iii) institutional strengthening; iv) increased competitiveness of investment and the national public budget; v) support for science and technology; and, vi) monitoring of the Contributions Determined at the National Level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, after a participatory process and prior consultation that began in July 2018<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>, the LMCC Regulation was approved by Supreme Decree No. 013-2019-MINAM. This norm regulates the provisions established in the Law for the planning, articulation, execution, monitoring, evaluation, reporting and dissemination of public policies for the integral management of climate change, aimed at the service of citizens, which seek to reduce the situation of vulnerability of the country against the effects of climate change, take advantage of low-carbon development opportunities and comply with the international commitments assumed by the Peruvian State before the UNFCCC. In this way, the LMCC Regulation establishes a multisectoral, multilevel and multiactor climate action, considering the inclusion of gender, intercultural and intergenerational approaches, as well as the monitoring of the NDC subject to continuous improvement. Incorporating these cross-cutting approaches makes it possible for Peru's national contributions and ambition to be fairer and more inclusive and to comply with the recommendations of the UNFCCC.</p>
<blockquote><strong><p>Peru will begin in 2021 the process of updating its National Strategy on Climate Change with a horizon to the year 2050.</p></strong></blockquote>
<p>Likewise, Article 10 of the LMCC provides for the creation of the High Level Commission on Climate Change (CANCC)<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> as the body that proposes adaptation and mitigation measures to climate change and NDCs, within the framework of the Paris Agreement; and, which approves the Update Report that must be submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat every five years. According to the Supreme Decree of its creation, the CANCC proposes and recommends, within the framework of Peru's National Strategy on Climate Change, actions to neutralize GHG emissions and adapt to climate change by 2050; as well as it proposes the progressive increase of the ambition of our national contributions, considering the proposals and recommendations elaborated by subnational governments, indigenous or native peoples, the private sector or any other non-state actor. In addition, it supervises the preparation of GHG emission reduction projections, which contribute to the decision-making process on NDCs, as well as proposes updating the methodologies used.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the mitigation measures of our NDCs, the measurement of the reduction of emissions and the increase of GHG removals, the LMCC Regulation establishes the creation of the National Registry of Mitigation Measures (RENAMI). The RENAMI's objective is to collect, record, monitor and manage information on the level of progress in emission reductions and in the increase of GHG removals from mitigation measures; as well as registering co-benefits, financing or other relevant information. RENAMI is a digital platform through which public and private institutions can register their initiatives that contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. In addition, through this platform, it will be possible to transfer the GHG reduction produced by the mitigation actions carried out by these institutions in order for them to participate in the national and international carbon markets, thus contributing to the action climate of the country.</p>
<p>In this way, with the objective of promoting compliance with our proposed mitigation goals, as well as greater ambition over time, Peru is committed to strengthening the multisectoral coordination work carried out through the CANCC. This work will make it possible to define the opportunities for reducing emissions for each of the sectors of the economy, which will make it possible to define the mitigation goal at the national level. Likewise, and in line with the commitment assumed for the construction of a reinforced transparency framework within the framework of the provisions of the Paris Agreement, Peru is updating the MRV tools with the objective of preparing the INGEI with a frequency not older than two years and to improve the quality of the information. This process is carried out through the Ministry of the Environment, in its capacity as the national authority on climate change, in coordination with the competent state sectors. Additionally, in order to ensure that updating the mitigation goals is advantageous and promotes the competitiveness of the country, Peru will seek to promote greater low-carbon investments in the sectors that have greater participation in the INGEI and/or that have greater co-benefits.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in order to guarantee the implementation of GHG mitigation measures and adaptation to climate change, the Peruvian State is in the process of formulating a Climate Financing Strategy. This Strategy, built in coordination between the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, will be one of the instruments for the comprehensive management of climate change and will allow addressing financial planning for the implementation of the NDC. In addition, its design takes into consideration the development of some central elements according to the particularities and main challenges of the country, among which the linking of the NDCs with policy and development instruments, the identification of financing gaps, stand out.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to indicate that Peru will begin in 2021 the process of updating its National Strategy on Climate Change with a horizon to the year 2050. In this sense, it has begun the participatory generation of two important references in relation to mitigation of GHG and adaptation to climate change through the preparation, on the one hand, of the Technical Study for Carbon Neutrality of Peru to 2050 and, on the other, the development of the National Adaptation Plan, with time horizons towards the years 2030 and 2050.</p>
<h2>6. Fair and ambitious NDCs in light of Peru's national circumstances</h2>
<p>Peru is deeply committed to the global response to climate change and considers it a priority that updating its national contributions incorporates the highest possible ambition, both in the objectives of adaptation to climate change and those concerning GHG mitigation. In this way, Peru recognizes that decisive, articulated and urgent action is required to limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 1.5°C, as well as to adequately manage the effects and impacts of climate change. Thus, the country has made efforts during the process of updating its NDCs to guarantee the increase in the ambition of its adaptation and mitigation measures, seeking to cover the entire national territory and promoting joint action between state and non-state actors, according to your circumstances and capabilities. In other words, Peru has strengthened its institutional framework for the comprehensive management of climate change in such a way that it guarantees and encourages the participation of the three levels of government and of civil society as a whole.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in accordance with the call established through Article 4.4. of the Paris Agreement, our national contributions consider actions, mechanisms and results that encompass our entire economy, with emphasis on the forestry sector due to its importance with respect to GHG emissions in the country. This scope is clearly reflected in our INGEI and in the public policies for the country's development, among which those aimed at the most vulnerable social groups, the population's livelihoods, the integrity of our ecosystems and the maintenance of the infrastructure, goods and services of the State.</p>
<p>The country's commitment has been reflected in the important milestones achieved in recent years. Among them, we can highlight: i) the institutional and regulatory framework; ii) efforts to implement our transparency framework through a monitoring system for adaptation and mitigation measures; iii) improvements of various kinds in the INGEI; iv) the production of basic information and scenarios that allow directing adaptation measures; v) the development of a climate finance strategy; and, vi) the incorporation of cross-gender, intercultural and intergenerational approaches in the measures that make up our contributions and in all processes related to the comprehensive management of climate change.</p>
<blockquote><strong><p>Our national contributions consider actions, mechanisms and results that encompass our entire economy, with an emphasis on the forestry sector due to its importance with respect to GHG emissions in the country.</p></strong></blockquote>
<p>Regarding the incorporation of cross-cutting approaches, it is important to indicate that the Peruvian State has made an effort to articulate and operationalize the elements of the Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>, which aim to legitimize climate action and guarantee the scope of national policies on climate change through broad citizen participation. Peru recognizes that capacities to mitigate climate change are lower in historically excluded populations, and that an action aimed at promoting citizen participation in the implementation of an adaptation measure cannot be carried out without considering the inequality and vulnerability of these social groups, as this would affect its scope, its impact and its sustainability. In this sense, the LMCC Regulation incorporates both the transversal approaches and the ACE elements in the conceptual framework for the integral management of climate change, while our NDC incorporates them in all its stages. from its formulation to its implementation. In this way, our national contributions are fair and inclusive.</p>
<p>In short, and in accordance with everything communicated in this document, the NDC of Peru corresponding to this update represent a progression with respect to the NDC presented in 2015. Additionally, the country has made this update of its national contributions taking into consideration and consistently with a long-term vision that leads us to achieve a balance between anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals and more favorable situations with regard to reducing risks and increasing adaptive capacity in 2050.</p>
<h2>7 Peruvian contribution to the achievement of the objective of the Convention</h2>
<p>Peru's NDCs will contribute so that the objectives of the UNFCCC related to stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system from being achieved, as well as increasing adaptation capacity, strengthening resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change with a view to contributing to sustainable and climate-responsible development.</p>
<blockquote><strong><p>The goals of our national contributions are aligned with a long-term vision for our emissions to peak as soon as possible.</p></strong></blockquote>
<p>The Peruvian State is committed to the global goal of keeping the increase in world average temperature well below 2°C with respect to pre-industrial levels, as well as to continue efforts to limit this increase to 1.5°C. To this end, it recognizes that meeting this goal would considerably reduce the risks and effects of climate change. In this sense, the goals of our national contributions are aligned with a long-term vision destined for our emissions to reach their maximum point as soon as possible, and, from that moment, to be rapidly reduced with the objective of reaching a balance between the anthropogenic emissions by sources and anthropogenic removals by sinks in the year 2050.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to highlight that the formulation of our NDC has been carried out in consistency with the principle of non-discrimination and the right to equality, taking into account the objectives of sustainable development, and strengthening the efforts of the State to eradicate poverty.</p>
