<h1><strong>Update of the Nationally Determined Contribution of Colombia (NDC)</strong></h1>
<p>The update of the NDC of Colombia was approved in the framework of the Ninth Session of the Intersectoral Commission on Climate Change, on December 10, 2020.</p>
<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>This document presents the update of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC, for its acronym in English) of the Republic of Colombia for the period 2020-2030. The NDC incorporates three components: i) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) mitigation, ii) adaptation to climate change, and iii) means of implementation as an instrumental component of policies and actions for low-carbon, adapted and climate-resilient development.</p>
<p>The health and economic crisis generated by COVID-19, as well as the 2020 hurricane season, which has broken records for being prolific in number of storms, demonstrate the importance of ensuring that the climate change agenda is integrated into the processes economic recovery in the short term, and in the development process in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>Assuming climate change as a national priority, Colombia approved in 2017 the National Climate Change Policy and in 2018 the Climate Change Law, which establish the guidelines for managing climate change in the country. Both the law and the policy seek to take advantage of synergies and leverage the regulatory framework and existing systems, and structure the National Climate Change System (SISCLIMA) as the primary axis for the institutionalization and internalization of climate change between actors and instruments.</p>
<p>In recent years, Colombia's planning instruments for climate action have been consolidated and put into operation. This has been reflected in the incorporation of climate change into the formal instruments of sectoral and territorial planning, through the formulation of Comprehensive Climate Change Management Plans at the sectoral (PIGCCS) and territorial (PIGCCT) levels.</p>
<p>This process of consolidating climate change management has been a fundamental part of the update of the NDC, which seeks to define goals and measures for climate change management for the period 2020-2030, and synergies are established with the 2030 Agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Likewise, the NDC is articulated with the Long-Term Strategy E2050 that Colombia will communicate to the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) in advance of COP26. The NDC integrates considerations recognized by the Paris Agreement as transversal to climate action, such as human rights, intergenerational equity, the just transition of the workforce, gender equality and the empowerment of women, the differential approach to ethnic communities and vulnerable populations, the integrity of ecosystems, the protection of biodiversity, the safeguarding of food security and eradication of poverty, and sustainable production and consumption, consolidating the efforts of sectors and territories in a path that allows Colombia to achieve its objectives of development, peace, equity and education in the medium term; long term.</p>
<p>In this context, the NDC update is presented in five chapters. The first raises the cross-cutting and integrating elements for updating the NDC, the second describes the updating process, and contains the consolidation of the goals and participation processes. The third chapter includes Colombia's Communication on Adaptation as part of the adaptation component of the NDC, in accordance with the provisions of articles 7.10 and 7.11 of the Paris Agreement and decision 9 / CMA.1 of the Conference of the Parties, in quality of meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. The fourth chapter contains the greenhouse gas mitigation component, according to the information guidelines intended to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of the NDCs under the Paris Agreement, established through of decision 4 / CMA.1. Finally, the fifth chapter describes the means of implementation component.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Cross-cutting and integrating elements</strong></h2>
<p>Colombia assumed a leadership role in the process of defining the new Post 2015 Agenda, and this update confirms that leadership through a concrete alignment between the SDGs and the goals and measures of the NDC.</p>
<p>Parallel to its updating process, the country has begun to examine the effects of the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures and means of implementation. This seeks to improve their understanding from the socio-economic perspective and to have better information that allows gradually improving their approach towards a decarbonization that is fair and inclusive.</p>
<p><em>Food security and poverty eradication</em></p>
<p>In line with its leadership in formulating the SDGs, Colombia recognizes the value of aligning efforts in terms of climate change, food security, and poverty eradication. To this end, the Department for Social Prosperity <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> has assumed the commitment to guarantee that 50% of its programs implement actions for risk management, adaptation and mitigation of climate change by 2030. This will be done gradually, strengthening its capacities by 2022, adopting guidelines for 2024, and implementing actions by 2030. </p>
<p><em>Just workforce transition</em></p>
<p>Colombia recognizes that the transition towards carbon neutrality and the onslaught of climate change, in conjunction with accelerated technological transformations, generate considerable impacts on the country's workforce. In line with this, the Ministry of Labor is leading the development by 2023 of a <em>Strategy for the just transition of the workforce towards a resilient and low-carbon economy. </em>The strategy will seek to contribute to improving the quality of life and the social and economic inclusion of the population, guaranteeing not leaving anyone behind and counting on a social dialogue that links the participation of employers, workers and the government, as well as active citizen participation in its design and implementation. It will also have application indicators for this purpose, including the definition of instances for its monitoring, and it will seek to articulate with the Long-Term Strategy for carbon-neutrality E2050, taking into account the territorial realities of the labor market.  </p>
<p><em>Human rights</em></p>
<p>In line with previous commitments, the Colombian State also considers that climate change has impacts on human rights and that these are differentiated towards groups with pre-existing inequalities and inequities, who do not have the same capacity or the means to face its consequences. These groups include indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, and peasant and rural populations, as well as other vulnerable populations such as displaced people and people in poverty. These groups can be especially affected by climatic events, including a higher incidence of environmental displacement. In the first half of 2020, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC) recorded 11,000 new displacements in the country as a result of natural disasters, mostly floods (IDMC, 2020). In this sense, the NDC's climate action will be consistent with human rights obligations, standards and principles for all people. Likewise, Colombia will articulate the fight against illegality with climate action, in recognition that illegal activities such as illegal extraction of minerals, illicit crops, illegal appropriation of land and drug trafficking are causes of environmental effects that impact the natural heritage of the country and also represent high risks for environmental defenders.</p>
<p><em>Intergenerational equity and territorial inclusion</em></p>
<p>The NDC seeks to honor the principle of intergenerational equity by protecting the environmental and socioeconomic environment for future generations, through ambitious goals in emission reduction and adaptation. As part of the NDC, it seeks to ensure participation and territorial balance by seeking the definition and inclusion of adaptation and mitigation goals and measures throughout the national territory that involve sub-national and non-state actors in climate actions to comply with national commitments.</p>
<p>Intergenerational equity and territorial inclusion are present in adaptation measures, as well as in the co-benefits that climate change mitigation actions bring to the present and future population of the country, such as the improvement in air quality and respiratory health, and the conservation of biodiversity through the protection of ecosystems and their ecosystem services.</p>
<p><em>Differential approach with ethnic and vulnerable communities</em></p>
<p>Colombia recognizes the central role that local communities play in achieving climate action goals. A significant proportion of the forests of Colombia, particularly in the Amazon and the Pacific, are located in reserves and collective territories of indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities and their preservation depends on the defense of ways of life appropriate to the territory, so they are indispensable actors for the achievement of the goal of reducing deforestation associated with the NDC. For its part, the involvement of peasant communities is essential to transform the agricultural-productive practices and rural development of the country, to avoid the expansion of the agricultural frontier and to safeguard the country's food security. The participation of these communities in the definition of climate actions and the strengthening of their governance will make it possible to strengthen the management of climate change in the territory.</p>
<p><em>Gender equality and empowerment of women</em></p>
<p>In recognition of the differentiated impact that climate change has on women and men, and the central role played by women in aspects such as agricultural production, food security and resilience in communities, Colombia has committed to orient the mainstreaming of the approach gender in the country's public policy. This includes the National Public Policy on Gender Equality, which will be deepened in the next five years to explicitly include climate change considerations, under the objectives and priority areas of the Improved Version of the Lima Work Program and its Action Plan for Gender.</p>
<p><em>Protection of water, ecosystems and biodiversity</em></p>
<p>Colombia, as a megadiverse country, must ensure that it preserves its enormous wealth in ecosystems, biodiversity and water resources. This is why, from the NDC adaptation and mitigation measures, special attention is paid to protected areas, as well as to the conservation and restoration of strategic ecosystems such as paramos, mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs, glaciers, oceans and tropical forests, in recognition of their intrinsic value and the environmental services they provide for Colombia and the world. Along the same lines, Colombia recognizes in this NDC the value provided by Nature-based Solutions (NBS), the bioeconomy, sustainable infrastructure and climate-smart agriculture. The PIGCCS of the environment sector contemplates a nature-based approach within its strategic lines.</p>
<p><em>Circular economy</em></p>
<p>Colombia recognizes the negative impact on health and ecosystems of the linear management of extraction, transformation, consumption and disposal resources, as well as its contribution to climate change. To address this challenge, Colombia published in 2019 its National Circular Economy Strategy, which establishes concrete lines of action, as well as indicators and goals, for the implementation of the circular economy in the country (MinAmbiente; MinCIT, 2019). Although still under development in the country, the circular economy is recognized as a key tool in the mitigation of GHG emissions in all economic sectors. Many of the measures presented in this update are heading in this direction.</p>
<p><em>Implementation in the context of COVID 19</em></p>
<p>The lower economic activity associated with the preventive closures due to COVID-19 in the world translated into very strong contractions in production and trade and a recession of magnitudes not seen in decades. The International Monetary Fund estimates for 2020 economic growth rates of -4.4% in the world and -8.1% for Latin America and the Caribbean. In the case of Colombia, decreases of -15.8% and -9.0% were observed in the second and third quarters of 2020, which translates into lower tax collection and greater pressure to mitigate the effects of the crisis in a the most vulnerable population and productive apparatus, which presents a substantial challenge for compliance with the NDC.</p>
<p>Faced with this global challenge, the country announced the "Commitment to sustainable growth" within the framework of the "Commitment to the future of Colombia" initiative, in which major energy transition and active restoration projects are prioritized, in line with the commitments national emissions reduction measures. Additionally, a Policy for Reactivation and Sustainable Growth will be issued shortly that incorporates actions to guarantee the environmental sustainability of the reactivation and thus contribute to the fulfillment of the NDC goal.</p>
<p>Colombia is in the process of quantifying the costs of implementing the NDC and the financial structuring required from the national, international, public and private levels. This process seeks to inform a first mapping of the allocation of resources that the Government will give from its national budget and to measure the participation of the private sector and the international support required by cooperating countries, whose contribution has been essential. International cooperation related to climate change has increased since 2015 on issues such as the fight against deforestation, implementation of renewable energies, and sustainable mobility in cities, which has allowed Colombia to move towards a more ambitious NDC, with additionality and impact.. The continuity of international cooperation will be key to continue on this path in all aspects of your NDC.</p>
<h2>2. NDC update process</h2>

<p>This update of the NDC is carried out and communicated under the principles of transparency and the guidelines established by the Rule Book of the Paris Agreement through decisions 4 / CMA.1, 9 / CMA.1, 18 / CMA. 1 and its annexes, based on the information presented by the country in its third National Communication (2017), its second BUR (2018) and its second Reference Level of Forest Emissions - NREF (2020), and presents improvements in some subsectors specific at the level of estimation of GHG emissions and removals.</p>
<p>Updating the NDC has been a government process, led by the technical teams of the sector ministries and other entities involved through the construction and strengthening of technical capacities. The process was carried out within the framework of SISCLIMA, with the Intersectoral Commission on Climate Change (CICC) as its leading body. This seeks to institutionalize and strengthen the process, through a governance that enables its continuity and follow-up in the future in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>The process had the participation of actors from various fields, including public, private, academic, and civil society actors. This, within the framework of a series of guiding principles that guided decision-making, such as the <em>principle of progression and not regression </em>, which encourages Colombia to increase its ambition in each update, and the principle of <em>always seeking to use the best information available. </em>The formulation and implementation of the NDC towards concrete policy and action measures in Colombia combines a top-down approach (where macroeconomic projections and official national data are considered) with a bottom-up approach (where the leadership of mitigation measures, adaptation and means of implementation is decentralized in the sectors and territories, and is communicated and aggregated at the national level).   </p>
<p>Colombia will consolidate in a follow-up plan for the implementation of the NDC the progress of the actions for the fulfillment of the goals and measures proposed as part of its commitment to 2030.</p>
<p>In this process, Colombia refers to the enhanced transparency framework (ETF), established under the Paris Agreement in its article 13, to promote transparency and mutual trust. This is reflected in a series of guiding principles that have guided the updating process in methodological terms and in decision-making, which are mentioned throughout the document. The sections that follow describe the development and results of this process.</p>
<h3>2.1. Consolidation of goals</h3>
<p>In accordance with the diversity of our nation and the existing differences between regions and communities, the updating of the NDC has had as fundamental axes the mainstreaming of responsibilities, and the transparency of its processes and assumptions. This seeks to generate a sense of responsibility regarding the management of climate change in sectors and territories, regarding the formulation of their actions in accordance with their capacities and in synergy with their development priorities.</p>
<p>This continuous work seeks that the actors are owners of the process of definition and implementation of their goals and measures, so that climate change management strengthens their lines of work and makes them more resilient in the short, medium and long term. In this sense, international cooperation has been crucial insofar as it contributes through technical and economic support to strengthen the capacities of the actors and amplify the scope of the process.</p>
<p>At the head of the ministries, the goals and measures are derived largely from the PIGCCS, specific instruments for each sector that reflect both their diagnosis and their lines of action, measures and goals; and include specific GHG emission reduction targets for each sector. The commitments of the PIGCCS included for the NDC were reviewed and discussed in sectoral technical tables, with the participation of multiple actors from the public and private sectors, and approved by the CICC.</p>
<p>At the territorial level, the main reference instruments for the consolidation of the NDC goals are the PIGCCT and other subnational management plans related to climate change, in which the territories formulate mitigation, adaptation measures and means of implementation adjusted to your needs and capabilities. The territories have shown important progress in the planning and implementation of measures, but there are still important gaps and challenges in the formulation, quantification and monitoring of measures at the subnational level, on which work will continue during the implementation period. In particular, the territorial mitigation goals included in the NDC were those with the greatest advances in their characterization and quantification, and had the consent of the departments and cities.</p>
<p>At the same time, Colombia began for this update a gradual process of involvement of companies and private sector entities in the management processes and goals of climate change in the country. This process has occurred in parallel with the formulation of the Long Term Strategy E2050, so that both processes feed into each other.</p>
<h3>2.2. Participation processes</h3>
<p>This update integrates multiple efforts and processes at the national, regional and local levels, such as the sectorial and territorial PIGCC, the Comprehensive Strategy for Deforestation Control and Forest Management (EICDGB), the Colombian Strategy for Low Carbon Development (ECDBC ), and the National Adaptation Plan (PNACC), among others. These processes have previously complied with their respective participation processes, to the extent required by Colombian law, and have had spaces to work with their stakeholders. The NDC brings together these processes and gives them an axis of convergence around the commitments acquired by Colombia at the national and international level.</p>
<p>Additionally, the update of the NDC incorporated participation mechanisms, socialization and awareness-raising exercises on the importance of climate change, dialogues with differential groups, technical work tables and workshops with sectorial and territorial actors. The section below describes these processes.</p>
<p><em>Technical work tables and workshops</em></p>
<p>From the sectoral point of view, the workshops and workshops were jointly organized by the respective sectoral ministries, with entities from the public, private, academic and civil society sectors. They have prioritized the participation of those actors who are responsible for the implementation, as well as those actors that may be affected by the implementation of the measures and goals for climate change management.</p>
<p>At the territorial level, the process included workshops convened with the Regional Climate Change Nodes, with people from all over the country who carry out activities related to climate change management, documenting their ethnic and gender diversity. The participants contributed their perspectives as actors in the process from various spheres: various managerial and technical levels of the national, regional and local government (for example, ministries, attached entities and other national government entities; Governments, and Mayors, Regional Autonomous Corporations), as well as representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and social and community organizations at the national, regional and local levels; unions, companies, members of the academy and various stakeholders.</p>
<p><em>Mechanisms for open participation and experts</em></p>
<p>The participation mechanisms, aimed at the general public, include a public consultation and a survey aimed at specialized audiences. While the public consultation sought to obtain feedback on the content of the NDC and its respective measures and goals, the surveys collected technical inputs to strengthen the update. The results of these processes were part of the inputs for the NDC review rounds through the CICC, with sectors and territories, which as a result led to adjustments to the NDC goals and measures.</p>
<p><em>Instruments of socialization and awareness</em></p>
<p>Taking into account the principles of access to information and public participation, there was also a participation and communications strategy for socialization and public awareness<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> on climate change management in the country and the updating of the NDC. To facilitate the effective participation of citizens, the communication pieces were designed from a segmentation of actors that allowed maintaining a multicultural and gender approach as far as possible, and adapting the messages to the level of knowledge and the needs of information from target audiences. The communication strategy included explanatory videos and graphic pieces on social networks and mass media, as well as live broadcasts through different social networks, which presented the NDC, the updating process, and the role of sectoral and territorial entities.</p>
<p><em>Dialogues with differential groups</em></p>
<p>In a complementary manner, spaces for dialogue were developed with grassroots communities and institutions to encourage their participation in the construction of the proposal to update the NDC. Ten dialogues were held with institutions of Afro-descendant, peasant, indigenous groups, youth organizations and women, with the participation of the directives and the accompaniment of the technical coordinators of the updating process in all cases. The dialogues made it possible to answer questions and compile feasible proposals, which provide key inputs to technical and decision-making bodies.</p>
<h2>3. Adaptation to climate change <em>(Communication on adaptation)</em> </h2>
<p>Colombia has chosen to develop a series of tools and guidelines that offer flexibility to sectors and territories to adjust their actions in adaptation to their conditions in the face of climate change. In addition to updating the adaptation component of the Colombian NDC, this section constitutes the <em>Communication in Adaptation </em>(hereinafter, CA) of Colombia.  </p>
<p>For the countries of the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), adaptation is one of the main elements of climate action. In addition to this, during the negotiation of the Paris Agreement and its Rule Book, it was agreed that the Parties can integrate adaptation components into their NDCs that reflect actions, needs and priorities in this matter, with a view to advancing towards the achievement of the objective. of the Agreement on adaptation.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>For Colombia, as a developing country, the AC has a prospective approach and should not generate an additional burden, so it focuses on providing information about the priorities and the implementation and support needs in this area. In this sense and in accordance with Decision 9CMA / 1, the CA of Colombia has prioritized the following elements, where the main axes are points 3 and 4.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>National circumstances</li>
<li>Risks and vulnerability</li>
<li>Adaptation priorities under the NDC (goals)</li>
<li>Required support needs (technology development and transfer, financing, and capacity building / strengthening of the country).</li>
</ol>
<p>Likewise, this document is consistent with the different instruments used to communicate, report and plan adaptation in Colombia, such as the National Communication (CNCC), the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) and the National Adaptation Plan (PNACC), with the so that they contribute to the effective management of this matter through the planning, application and communication of actions.</p>
<h3>3.1. National circumstances</h3>
<p>This section offers an updated perspective of the biophysical, social and economic characteristics of Colombia, giving context to the actions and goals of adaptation to climate change in the country. This information is based on what was presented in the Second Biennial Update Report submitted to the UNFCCC in 2018 (IDEAM, UNDP, MinAmbiente, DNP, CANCILLERÍA, 2018), and is updated according to the latest available official data.</p>
<p>Colombia recognizes the importance of collecting differentiated information that helps to describe the social circumstances of different groups in the national territory. This includes, for example, data differentiated by sex, data on gender inequalities relevant to adaptation and mitigation actions, data on impacts and vulnerabilities differentiated by gender, and data that helps to make ethnic groups and peasants visible. In the future, Colombia hopes to strengthen this information gathering process to form a more robust picture of national circumstances.</p>

<h3>3.2. Risk and vulnerability</h3>
<p>In recent years, the country has made progress in conducting vulnerability and risk analysis due to climate change, not only on a national scale by administrative units of departments and municipalities, but has also focused on the services of socio-ecological systems such as wetlands, and in productive sectors such as agriculture. This analysis, introduced in the Third National Communication on Climate Change (TCNCC), is based on 113 indicators distributed in the components of Threat, Sensitivity, and Adaptive Capacity, subdivided into six dimensions: Food Security, Water Resources, Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, Health, Human Habitat and Infrastructure (see indicators in Annex A1).</p>
<p>Additionally, based on the TCNCC and the AR5 report of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC), Colombia has sought to deepen the understanding of its vulnerability and risk to climate change. This has been done through initiatives such as the vulnerability and risk analysis to climate change of the floodplains of the Magdalena-Cauca macro-basin (IDEAM -TNCCC 1)<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>; and the vulnerability and risk analysis to climate change carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), with the support of IDEAM<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This has allowed the construction of better quality hazard, vulnerability, and risk maps, such as those presented in the figures below (see maps in more detail in Annex A2).</p>

<h3>3.3. Adaptation Priorities within the NDC Framework</h3>
<p>Since the presentation of its first NDC, Colombia has shown significant progress in the achievement of its goals, which have laid the foundations for the goals presented in this update (a diagnosis of progress on the goals of the current NDC is you can see in Annex A4).</p>
<p>The adaptation component of the NDC in its updated version has greater ambition due to the fact that the goals established in 2015 (10 goals) have been reviewed and developed into proposals for more concrete actions to incorporate adaptation to climate change at different levels of the country planning.</p>
<p>The goals reflected in this chapter focus on areas such as: water resources, protection of coastal terrestrial and marine ecosystems, restoration, protected areas, infrastructure and agriculture, which are related to the risk dimensions presented in the TCNCC.</p>
<p>Seeking to take advantage of possible synergies, adaptation priorities are aligned with the risk and vulnerability dimensions identified as priorities for the country in the TCNCC, be consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals and their approach in the country, and with other international agendas such as, for example, the Sendai Framework for Action.</p>
<p>Regarding the TCNCC, as part of its Analysis of Vulnerability and Risk due to Climate Change, the country presented a battery of 113 indicators in the components of threat, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, distributed in six dimensions (food security, water resources, biodiversity and ecosystem services, human habitat, health and infrastructure). A description of the dimensions of the TCNCC, as well as the related indicators, can be found in Annex A1.</p>
<p>Colombia's priorities (goals) for 2030 are in the following table. It is noteworthy that detailed information on the goals established with respect to their objective, description, baselines, compliance milestones and measurement indicators can be found in the document attached to this NDC. The information is reflected through cards and is an integral part of the CA of Colombia.</p>

<h3>Alignment of NDC goals with PNACC strategic lines</h3>
<p>For Colombia, the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC) constitutes the mechanism that guides the management and organizes the national planning processes in matters of adaptation, and articulates the implementation of policies, plans, actions and projects to reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity to the possible impacts of climatic phenomena in the country. Colombia is currently formulating the PNACC Action Plan with support from the Preparedness Program for National Adaptation to Climate Change financed with resources from the Green Climate Fund.</p>
<p>Said Plan seeks to promote effective implementation in adaptation through monitoring the phases of the process cycle (knowledge, planning and transformation), and indicates actions of means of implementation necessary to achieve the objectives set from the country's adaptation goals.. It also seeks to guide coordinated action between actors, public and private, through the consolidation and analysis of sectoral and territorial advances. The Action Plan will be finalized in 2021 and once validated, it will be sent to the UNFCCC to rest in the Central NAP<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The difference between the Communication in Adaptation (CA) and the PNACC is that the former presents the priorities and needs with specific goals and a long-term vision, in line with the Paris Agreement and its global goals, while the PNACC identifies national planning processes and objectives broadly and addresses the spectrum of country adaptation management in short, medium and long term periods. Thus, the PNACC and the CA are mutually feeding instruments.</p>
<p>The country seeks coherence between the different instruments used to communicate, report and plan adaptation in Colombia (Communication in adaptation (CA), National Communication (CNCC) - Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) - National Adaptation Plan (PNACC), in order to contribute to the effective management of the matter through the planning, application and communication of actions In this sense, an initial approach of the goals of the NDC with the objectives and strategies of the PNACC is presented below.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Figure 6. Alignment of the NDC goals with the strategic lines of the PNACC</em></p>
<p><img src="COL-NDC1-6.jpg" style="width:4.90667in;height:3.36333in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6 shows that the goals set in the NDC are distributed in the three phases of the PNACC process. It should be noted that the majority (23) are associated with the first two phases: knowledge and planning. However, 16 of the 30 goals of the NDC reflect transformation options that will make it possible to meet the objective of having a more resilient and climate-adapted country.</p>
<h3>3.4 Required support needs</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the Biennial Transparency Reports under the Paris Agreement, the possibility is provided for each Party to provide information related to impacts and adaptation to climate change (Article 13.8), and for developing countries to present information on support required and received. (article 13.10).</p>
<p>In preparing the AC, the country has taken into account the categories of information on required support that must be included in the BTRs. For Colombia, this constitutes an approach that ensures coherence in the needs and priorities that arise in this matter. This seeks to avoid an additional burden for countries when preparing the reports of Article 13, and generate relevant experiences in the framework of the negotiation of the Supplementary Guide for Communication in Adaptation that will take place in 2022.</p>
<p>The country has identified 132 needs with respect to financing, capacity building / building, and technology development and transfer (presented in Annex A4), despite not having a standardized methodology to identify them. It should be noted that the information presented does not fully reflect the country's needs and it will be necessary to continue working on these aspects. However, this initial approach will guide the country's work for the implementation of the commitments, future international cooperation and possible allocation of resources from the national budget.</p>
<p><em>Figure 7. Identified support needs</em></p>
<p><img src="COL-NDC1-7.jpg" style="width:4.66157in;height:3.16333in" /></p>
<p>Finally, 11 types of needs have been identified for technology development and transfer, 5 for capacity building / strengthening and 10 for financing.</p>

<h3>Methodological approach to the costing of adaptation priorities (goals) within the framework of the NDC (DNP, 2020)</h3>
<p>Colombia is developing an estimate that allows an approximation of the costs that the country must incur to achieve its adaptation priorities (goals). With this purpose, an analysis is being carried out using two approaches, the convergence of which allows structuring a useful costing model for this and future updates. Both methodologies require iterative processes that will be updated over time according to the best information that is available.</p>
<p><em>Methodology for estimating climate finance needs for adaptation at the national level (from top to bottom)</em></p>
<p>The economic study of gaps (top-down methodology) by the National Planning Department (DNP) analyzes the difference between the economic growth scenario without climate change and the scenario under the impacts of climate change, estimating the effective investment in adaptation necessary to fill this gap. This methodology starts from the potential growth of macroeconomic production (that is, the expected growth of the economy) and estimates the additional investments in physical and human capital necessary to achieve this level of growth in a scenario that requires adaptation measures to climate change ( Barbier, 2015) (Lipschitz &amp; Schadler, 2019).</p>
<p>As it is based on the production function of the economy, this methodology can be replicated more easily, given the availability of information related to macroeconomic data at the national level and the access to the necessary resources to carry it out.</p>
<p>This approximation offers a result relative to national GDP. The study, which is still in the process of review and adjustment, indicates that the annual investment in adaptation to climate change should be 0.2% of national GDP by 2030, to close the gap between potential economic growth and low economic growth. the impacts of climate change. In Colombian pesos (COP) for 2019, this corresponds to approximately 2 trillion pesos per year (approximately USD 600 million<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>) until 2030. This figure should be taken as a minimum value, since it considers investment in human and physical capital, but not other measures which are also crucial for effective adaptation in the country (for example, natural capital measures).</p>
<p><em>Adaptation goal costing pilot (bottom-up)</em></p>
<p>The goal-level costing methodology (based on a bottom-up approach) seeks to estimate the cost of each adaptation goal by type of action, in accordance with current policy instruments in the country, in order to measure the financing needs to achieve 5 adaptation goals selected from the NDC update. The methodology used is based on an adjustment of existing methodologies used for similar exercises both in Colombia and in other countries, and had the validation of different actors by the Government of Colombia.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> As a result, there will be the development of a methodology that can be applied to the adaptation goals of the NDC proposed in this update, as well as to new goals proposed in future updates. </p>
<p>The main objective of this exercise is to support the government decision-making process related to adaptation costs, however, it is not a detailed estimate of adaptation actions. The detailed estimate of the budget must be carried out in parallel with the structuring of each action. Therefore, the methodology suggests following a pragmatic approach where, according to the existing information, different paths are followed when estimating costs, which recognizes possible ranges of uncertainty in the information. To meet the objective, a decision tree has been developed from which Colombia's adaptation goals are classified according to the availability of information and existing policies related to climate change, to allow the estimation of the costs of certain types of goals. based on approximate investment, operation and maintenance values. At the same time, among the advances, the realization of a pilot with 5 adaptation goals for this update stands out, as shown in the following table.</p>
<p>This approach seeks to make use of existing information to reduce uncertainty and complexity in capturing information, setting its calculation methodology based on the information available and facilitating its updating in the future. The table below shows the goals selected for this first costing phase, the classification of information availability, and the costing methodology used.</p>

<h2>4. Mitigation of GHG emissions</h2>
<p>Recognizing the importance of incorporating climate change criteria in the short, medium and long term economic reactivation and vulnerability to climate change, the GHG mitigation goal for the 2020-2030 period is defined and presented. Through an ambitious and forceful goal, Colombia seeks to highlight the sense of urgency to take definitive actions to prevent extreme weather events that are increasingly hitting the national territory, such as hurricanes, landslides, and floods.</p>
<p>Colombia's updated goal is based on a long-term vision that is established by the aspiration towards carbon neutrality manifested by the country at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in September 2019, and which will be reflected in the Long-Term Strategy E2050, a medium-term vision to 2030 that is established through the Colombian Strategy for Low Carbon Development and the Comprehensive Strategy for Deforestation Control and Forest Management, and a short-term vision through the National Plan for Development.</p>
<p>Among the key advances in the execution of this long-term vision in terms of mitigation and that contribute to the achievement of the goal, are included the instruments created by Law 1931 on climate change, promulgated in 2018, including the National Quota Program Issue Tradables; the PIGCCS<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and the mitigation measures of each one of the ministries; the PIGCCT, the national carbon tax and the non-causation of the carbon-neutrality tax (Law 1819/2016 and Decree 926/2017); Law 1715 of 2014 on Renewable Energies; Resolution 1447 of 2018 of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development on the monitoring, reporting and verification system of mitigation actions at the national level; the 1964 Law of 2019 on Electric Mobility; the 1972 Law of 2019 on air quality, in addition to important policy instruments such as CONPES 3874 for Comprehensive Solid Waste Management, CONPES 3919 for Sustainable Construction, CONPES 3934 for Green Growth, the National Circular Economy Strategy of 2019, among others. </p>
<p>In terms of reducing deforestation and protecting ecosystems, there is a broad and evolving regulatory and implementation framework, highlighting the delimitation of the agricultural frontier in 2018, the creation of the National Council to Fight Deforestation and other Associated Environmental Crimes in 2019, the leadership and signing of the Leticia Pact in 2019; Law 1930 on protection of paramo ecosystems, Decree Law 870 of 2017 and 1007 of 2018 on Payments for Environmental Services. Likewise, the implementation of the REDD + Amazon Vision Program from 2016, the Sustainable Development program low in Carbon for the Orinoquia and the signing of the Joint Declaration of Intent with Norway, United Kingdom and Germany on Reduction of Deforestation and Sustainable Development in 2015 and endorsed in 2019, among others.</p>
<p>The following sections seek to offer relevant and sufficient information aimed at facilitating clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of Colombia's contribution to GHG mitigation, using as main guideline what is contained in Annexes 1 and 2 of Decision 4 / CMA.1, and with transparency as one of its primary axes.</p>
<p>Colombia's mitigation goal is established based on the projection and analysis of its reference scenario (trend growth in emissions in the absence of implementation of GHG mitigation actions) and the analysis and modeling of policy scenarios and reduction measures. of GHG emissions to reach the goal.</p>
<p>Colombia still presents great challenges regarding the consolidation and modeling of information, so not all the measures identified to date in the country have been included, to which is added the need to maintain continuous work that continues to incorporate actions of sectors and territories towards the fulfillment of the proposed goal.</p>

<h3>4.1 Description of the baseline scenario</h3>
<p>The reference scenario (VITO, Universidad de los Andes, CIAT, Universidad de Wageningen, SEI, ESMIA, 2020) uses two types of sectoral classifications: the IPCC categories and assignments to sectoral portfolios at the national level (intended to provide clear references allocation, management and reporting on these commitments) for which a standardization was made between IPCC categories and ministerial portfolios at the national level.</p>

<p>Colombia's NDC is fair to the extent that it responds to the vulnerability of our territory to the impacts of climate change and puts on the table Colombia's contribution as a middle-income developing country. It is also ambitious as it significantly exceeds our 2015 emission reduction target, committing today to reducing emissions of 176 Mt CO2 eq. In this way, Colombia responds forcefully to the call of science, indicated in the IPCC Report of 1.5°C (IPCC, 2019), and includes all sectors of our economy.</p>
<p><em>Deforestation</em></p>
<p>Given its particular conditions, the goal of reducing emissions from deforestation part of the NDC is calculated independently and in a unified manner at the national level in line with the projections of the NREF until 2030, and will be monitored from the Forest and Carbon Monitoring System (SMByC). The stated mitigation goal contemplates a reduction in emissions from deforestation equivalent to reducing the deforestation rate to 50,000 ha / year in 2030.</p>
<p>The country plans to make use of cooperative and market approaches, including those of article 6.2 or those that imply the use of mitigation results of international transfer, for the fulfillment of the complementary goal to the NDC of reducing deforestation of natural forest to 0 hectares / year net to 2030.</p>
<p>The trajectory of the goal of reducing emissions from deforestation by 2030 includes an expected deforestation trend of 155,000 ha / year in 2022 and 100,000 ha / year in 2025, figures that are in accordance with the aspiration indicated in the Joint Declaration of Colombia with Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom on reducing deforestation and sustainable development (Republic of Colombia, the Kingdom of Norway, Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 2019), which includes a contribution to the country of up to USD 366 million by 2025 for the achievement of these results and other policy milestones in reducing deforestation.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, the importance of inter-institutional management of forest fires is recognized, which contribute to the emission of GHG and are, at the same time, exacerbated in frequency and magnitude as a consequence of climate change. Colombia has first developed an approach with risk management as the main focus, which can be seen in greater detail in the adaptation component of this update. In the coming years, Colombia hopes to strengthen its knowledge and information management with respect to GHG emissions caused by forest fires in the country, with a view to implementing actions to calculate a mitigation potential.</p>
<p><em>Exclusions</em></p>
<p>Colombia does not include all carbon pools in the NDC because, for some of the categories that involve them, there are still information gaps at the national level that will require progress in the coming years, in order to improve the required estimates. These categories correspond to marine and coastal ecosystems (that is, blue carbon ecosystems outside the forest category), high mountain ecosystems (páramos), and urban woodland.</p>
<p>The emission and / or removal categories that in the National GHG Inventory Report-NIR, have the annotations of Not Estimated (NE) and Not Applicable (NA) in 2014 are not accounted for by the NDC.<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>As in the NDC presented in 2015, carbon dioxide removals by the natural forest that remains as such (removals of category 3b1ai) that do not obey a restoration process are not counted, since the origin of these removals it is not anthropogenic.</p>
<p>Below is a list of carbon pools not included in Colombia's mitigation goal.</p>

<p>Colombia recognizes the importance of high mountain ecosystems, marine and coastal ecosystems, as well as the solution to urban challenges and the use of opportunities for the inclusion of biodiversity and ecosystem services within Colombian cities for comprehensive management of climate change.</p>
<p>Given the challenges presented by the lack of information on the dynamics of carbon and other greenhouse gases in these ecosystems in the national territory, actions will be identified and developed that seek to strengthen the capacity to create knowledge related to the role of these ecosystems in the mitigation of GHG through the strengthening of the National Climate Change Information System, its different subsystems and platforms, and the respective articulation with entities of the National Environmental System SINA, within the framework of its different planning instruments, the PIGCC and the Policy National of Climate Change.</p>
<p>In this sense, the definition of work routes concerning the resolution of information challenges for decision-making on climate change management in said land cover will be developed within the framework of inter-institutional technical spaces.</p>
<p>For the carbon pool of harvested wood products, this update does not have a breakdown related to its end use to be able to apply the guidelines related to accounting for said pool. Colombia will work during the NDC implementation period to improve the accounting of said deposit and consequently the mitigation of GHG in categories 3B1ai and 3B1aiii. Likewise, Colombia will develop an accounting rule on emissions from fires and natural disturbances for the determination of corresponding exclusions from accounting in the NDC according to international best practices.</p>
<p><em>Methodological Approaches to Carbon Accounting</em></p>
<p>Colombia has developed the accounting system for the reduction of emissions and removal of GHG, a set of processes, technologies, protocols and accounting rules that determine the emissions, reductions of emissions and removals of GHG that are accounted for, with the objective of generating reports and demonstrate progress in meeting national climate change goals established under the UNFCCC. In this way, it seeks to tend towards the reasonable consistency of the national accounting of GHG reductions and removals, under the principles of transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability, coherence, prevention of double counting and environmental integrity.</p>
<p>In order to effectively assign responsibilities to the actors in charge of implementation, Colombia has established, within the SISCLIMA framework, a homologation of GHG emissions between the IPCC categories and the portfolio sectors, which corresponds to the competencies of the portfolio sectors in the framework Colombian Institution (MinAmbiente-DCCGR, 2020). In addition, accounting rules have been agreed for the monitoring and recognition of GHG emission reductions and removals within the framework of the mitigation sector commitments (MinAmbiente-DCCGR, 2020).</p>
<p>The accounting of the NDC will be carried out in the National Accounting System, regulated by Resolution 1447 of 2018 of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, in accordance with the accounting rules set forth there, as well as those mentioned above established under SISCLIMA, and those future rules to be developed, including the issues of harvested wood products, natural disturbances, and in response to the guidelines of the cooperative and market approaches of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement or other international agreements.</p>
<p>Colombia intends to report in the Biennial Transparency Reports monitoring indicators for both GHG emissions and GHG emissions reduction for compliance with the NDC. For the emissions, the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases will be taken as the main source, and for the reduction of emissions, the National Emission Reduction Registry (RENARE) will be taken as the main source.</p>
<p><em>Black carbon</em></p>
<p>Considering that black carbon is one of the main pollutants responsible for the deterioration of air quality and the main factor of environmental risk to health, Colombia contemplates, within the framework of its NDC, the adoption of measures to reduce pollutant emissions short-lived climate conditions (SLCPs), including black carbon. For this purpose, the National Strategy for the Mitigation of Short-lived Climate Pollutants has been drawn up, which seeks to improve the mechanisms for managing information related to short-lived climate pollutants, adopt and promote the use of tools to estimate the benefits associated with reduce their emission, strengthen institutional capacity, replicate successful cases of application of the tools adopted, and make visible the contribution of said tools to institutional strengthening and meeting goals (MinAmbiente, 2020).</p>
<p>In line with this, Colombia has defined a national goal to reduce black carbon emissions of 40% compared to the 2014 emissions level (IDEAM, MinAmbiente, Coalición del Clima y Aire Limpio, 2019). This target does not include black carbon emissions associated with forest and grassland fires, as there is insufficient information on this activity. In other words, considering a black carbon emission of 15,235 tons in 2014 (excluding fires), Colombia's maximum black carbon emission in 2030 will be 9,195 tons.</p>
<p><em>Figure 13. Black carbon emission reduction target by 2030</em></p>
<p><img src="COL-NDC1-13.png" /></p>

<h3>4.3. Measures to achieve the goal</h3>
<p>Within the framework of its NDC, Colombia has identified a portfolio of measures whose implementation will support the fulfillment of its GHG mitigation goal. This portfolio consists of a list of 32 national measures (led by ministerial portfolios), 89 sub-national measures (led by territorial entities), 24 measures led by companies and 3 specific measures to reduce black carbon, for a total of 148 measures. These measures have been consolidated by the actors responsible for their implementation, in concert with the other actors in order to achieve the common mitigation goal. This list was approved at the intersectoral level as a package of measures that does not pretend to be exhaustive and on which new measures or increased potentials should continue to be incorporated by the actors in charge. The measures are varied in nature, incorporating public policy and regulatory actions, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), sector programs, individual projects; with implementation scales from the national to the municipal and business. These measures do not include those mitigation actions established prior to 2015, as these correspond to the baseline scenario.</p>
<p>Most of the sectoral mitigation measures come or will be reflected in the PIGCCS, formulated and being finalized<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>. However, the mitigation potential of the sectoral measures has been modeled in the mitigation scenario (VITO, Universidad de los Andes, CIAT, Unviersidad de Wageningen, SEI, ESMIA, 2020) with respect to the updated reference scenario, recalculating with respect to to previous exercises.</p>
<p>The goal of reducing emissions from deforestation in the context of the NDC is presented as an intersectoral goal, due to the required interference of multiple portfolios for its materialization. The actions leading to this goal are multiple and are extensively reflected in the EICDGB (MinAmbiente, IDEAM, 2018), the CONPES National Policy for the Control of Deforestation and Sustainable Management of Forests and other related policy documents. Colombia recognizes the fundamental role that indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities play in the protection and sustainable use of forests in Indigenous Reservations and Collective Territories of Black Communities, which cover a very significant portion of the country's natural forests, particularly in the Amazon and the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>The territorial mitigation measures come mainly from the PIGCCT or sustainable mobility projects in cities and correspond to measures with clear and quantitative implementation goals supported by governments, regional autonomous corporations<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> and municipal governments to explicitly contribute to the NDC. For their part, corporate mitigation measures come from companies with established corporate mitigation goals which indicated their consent to explicitly contribute to the mitigation goal of the NDC. </p>
<p>The contribution of the territorial and business measures are not included in the mitigation scenario for this update, but are included qualitatively, with the exception of those referring to the Bogotá Metro and the Cundinamarca Regiotram. During the implementation period, Colombia hopes to quantify the potential of territorial and business measures in its mitigation scenario, as well as incorporate new measures that arise from other actors, to the extent that more and better information is available, characterizing them in detail applying additionality criteria and avoiding double counting in their modeling.</p>
<p>The country will indicate in the Biennial Transparency Reports the new measures that have been added to the NDC implementation portfolio, in addition to those circumstances in which the measures and / or their corresponding goals have been adjusted, modified or withdrawn from the portfolio, without detriment. of the aggregate fulfillment of the national GHG mitigation goal.</p>
<p>Annex M1 contains the list of sector measures with their respective leading ministries and the corresponding goals. Likewise, the territorial and business measures verified and with the consent of departments, regional autonomous corporations, cities and companies are listed. Likewise, the territorial and business measures verified and with the consent of departments, regional autonomous corporations, cities and companies are listed.</p>
<p>The black carbon reduction goal also considers the co-benefits associated with the sectoral GHG mitigation measures presented in this update. The GHG emission mitigation measures that contribute the most to the goal of reducing black carbon emissions are the replacement of traditional wood stoves with efficient stoves, the improvement of the brick industry, the measures associated with transportation, in particular the replacement of vehicles with diesel engines, and the panela NAMA. These GHG mitigation actions present additional co-benefits in terms of public health, due to the improvement of local air quality related to the reduction in emissions of criteria pollutants.</p>
<p>Colombia recognizes the need to quantify the co-benefits in terms of health associated with the improvements in air quality that result from the implementation of GHG mitigation measures, such as those reported through this update of our NDC. To this end, a national study will be carried out to quantify the health co-benefits associated with the improvements in air quality resulting from the implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation measures by the Colombian government in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and partner organizations. The economic and health benefits will be calculated by analyzing the impact path of the CarbonH tool. This, in turn, will facilitate the integration and formulation of policies both from the environment sector and from the health sector and social awareness about the collateral benefits in terms of air quality and health associated with the implementation of climate change mitigation measures..</p>
<h2>Means of Implementation</h2>
<p>The Means of Implementation seek to establish the conditions that allow the creation of a favorable environment to carry out the actions required to meet the goals established in the NDC and the progressive increase in ambition.</p>
<p>For this, a common framework for action is necessary to identify strategic areas of national scope and, at the same time, integrate the particular characteristics of climate change management in sectors and territories. This common framework lays the foundations for a pragmatic approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation actions through means of implementation, and favors the creation of spaces and coordination mechanisms for decision-making and the participation of different actors.</p>
<p>The management of means of implementation in Colombia occurs through five areas that complement each other, in which a set of milestones are proposed, which serve as an articulating axis to identify the needs of the goals and proposed measures in mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p><em>Figure 14. Milestones according to areas of the means of implementation to be reached by 2030</em></p>
<p><img src="COL-NDC1-14.jpg" style="width:4.84in;height:3.94667in" /></p>

<p>This articulation is supported by the identification of institutional support frameworks for implementation, public and private interest groups, vulnerable populations, strategic partners, coordination bodies, and definition of roles, responsibilities and scope for implementation, follow-up, monitoring and evaluation. of the implementation process. Additionally, there are thematic axes that cross-link mitigation measures and adaptation goals, in order to facilitate implementation.</p>

<h2>Black carbon policies and measures</h2>
<p>The commitment to reduce black carbon emissions is consistent with Colombia's general GHG mitigation effort, with the addition of specific environmental decontamination measures, mainly related to the technological change of mobile sources and off-road machinery, and the reduction of agricultural burns. The goal contemplates the reductions associated with measures that directly address black carbon and other air pollutants, which are in addition to the GHG mitigation measures in the NDC.</p>
