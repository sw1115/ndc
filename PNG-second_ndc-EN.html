<h1>Papua New Guinea’s Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution 2020</h1>
<h2>The Summary</h2>
<p>PNG reported total net Green House Gas
(GHG) emissions in 2015 of 15,193 Gg CO2 eq
compared to -14,179 Gg CO2 eq in 2000, a
net increase of close to 30,000 Gg CO2 eq<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
These increases were driven by a combination
of increases in emissions from the energy sector
linked to a growing economy and development
of PNG’s natural gas reserves as well as increases
in emissions and a reduction in accounted for
removals<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> from the LULUCF sector.</p>




<p>PNG is committed to working to reverse this growth
in emissions as part of the global fight against
climate change and recognition of the country’s
vulnerability to its impacts - PNG is ranked as one
of the 10 vulnerable countries in the world to the
risks of climate change.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>



<p>This NDC provides information on PNG’s key
commitments to both mitigate and address
the impacts of climate change. It builds on
and enhances ambition from PNG’s first NDC
(submitted in 2015) through inclusion of additional
sector targets for LULUCF and adaptation as well
as increasing information on the nature of these
targets in line with the Enhanced Transparency
Framework (ETF). The NDC also recognizes the
important role that improved collection and
management of emissions related data across
the economy will have in PNG’s capacity to
further enhance ambition and respond to
climate change.</p>


<p>A summary of PNG’s commitments is presented
below. All commitments are conditional in
recognition of PNG’s position as a developing
national with limited resources and capacity
and cover an implementation period of 2020 to
2030.</p>


<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>PNG’s emissions and recent increases are
primarily driven by the AFOLU and Energy
sectors, which accounted for 13,522 Gg
CO2 eq, or 89% of reported net emissions
in 2015. Total emissions from the energy
sector in 2015 were 11,806 Gg CO2 eq, an
increase of 5,532 Gg CO2 eq (88.2%) from
2000<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Energy industries and Manufacturing
industries and construction accounted for
5,596 (47%) Gg CO2 eq of these emissions in
2015<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and include emissions from on and off
grid electricity generation and operation of the
LNG plants.</p>



<p>Within the AFOLU sector, Land Use, Land Use
Change and Forestry sector (LULUCF) is the
biggest contributor to GHG emissions in PNG
accounting for net emissions of 1,717 Gg CO2
eq in 2015 compared to -21, 636 Gg CO2 eq
in 2000 which is a total decrease of removals
amounting to 23,370 Gg CO2 eq.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>


<p>As such this enhanced NDC focuses on targets
and actions within these two sectors specifically
the LULUCF sector<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> and Energy Industries subsectors,
while also noting opportunities for
action within the transport subsector and a
commitment to enhance ambition in the way
that PNG collects and manages data within
them and across all emitting sectors to allow
for further refinement and enhancement of
ambition within future updates.</p>





<h4>Mitigation Targets</h4>
<p>PNG has enhanced its NDC commitments
by presenting targets for both the Energy
Industries and LULUCF sectors, which made
up 38% of PNG’s reported net emissions in
2015<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> consideration of possible actions within
the transport sector are also presented. Across
both sectors targets are based against a 2015
baseline with the target period covering 2021-
2030. All targets presented are conditional.</p>



<h5>Energy Industries:</h5>
<p>Within the Energy Industries PNG is committing
to a headline target of carbon neutrality
within the energy industries sub-sector by
2030.</p>


<p><em>This will be achieved by:</em></p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Reducing energy demand</strong> - through
adoption and implementation of
Minimum Energy Performance Standards
and Labelling (MEPSL) Regulations as well
as enhancing public awareness of energy
use and means of reducing energy use.</li>

<li><strong>Enhancing levels of renewables in the
energy mix </strong>– through increasing from
30% (2015) to 78% the level of installed
capacity for on grid electricity generation
that is produced by renewables<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</li>




<li><strong>Establishing a framework for fossil
fuel emission offsetting </strong>– PNG remains
committed to an energy transition but also
recognizes that a full transition will take
time given PNG’s complex geographies
and dispersed population as well as
growing economy. As such a framework
for offsetting of emissions from fossil fuels
will be introduced to support economic
incentives for the transition while also
helping to finance domestic nature based
solutions in particular reduced emissions
and enhanced removals from the forest
sector.</li>





<li><strong>Enhanced data collection</strong> – Specific
GHG targets are not currently possible
for energy industries within PNG due
to limitations of data availability. To
strengthen this process PNG will establish a
framework for enhanced data collection
on energy use and associated emissions
to support improved policy and regulation
to manage emissions.</li></ul>




<h5>Transport</h5>
<p>In addition PNG will continue to review
appropriate options and approaches to
reducing emissions from the transport subsector.</p>



<h5>Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)</h5>
<p>By 2030, PNG is committing to a reduction
in annual emission from deforestation and
forest degradation, due to agriculture
expansion and commercial logging of
10,000 Gg CO2 eq compared to 2015
level. This target is significant in itself but
should also be seen in the context of PNG’s
projected business as usual scenario for the
forest sector which would result in significant
increases in levels of emissions (see Figure 1)
As such PNG is working to deliver a significant
change is the emission trend within the
sector.</p>

<p><img src="PNG-NDC2_1.png"/></p>

<p>Figure 1 PNG’s annual GHG emissions and removals between 2001 and 2015, the future emissions prediction under the
business as usual scenario and an illustrative pathway to
the NDC target for the LULUCF sub-sector.</p>
<p>This target will be achieved by a 25% reduction
in both the area of annual deforestation and
annual degradation against 2015 levels
(equating to a reduction in annual deforestation
of 8,300 ha or annual degradation of
43,300ha) as well as an increase in the area
of forest planted.</p>



<p>In additional PNG will continue to take action to
strengthen the quality and nature of reporting
on the LULUCF sector to allow for better
accounting of the sustainable management
of forests as well as reviewing how best to
account for removals from PNG’s extensive
forest resource. This will be supported by
improvements in information and reporting on
agriculture to allow for its inclusion within future
NDCs.</p>



<h3>Adaptation</h3>
<p>The enhanced NDC will focus on four (4)
development sectors central to PNG’s ability to
adapt to climate change namely agriculture,
health, infrastructure, and transport. This sectoral
focus is in line with the PNG National Adaptation
Plan, which is currently under development.
The adaptation targets are measured against
beneficiaries for the agriculture and health
sectors, and the value and number of assets
for the transport and infrastructure sector and
are summarized below:</p>


<ul><li>100% of PNG’s population to benefit from
introduced health measures to respond
to malaria and other climate-sensitive
diseases;</li>


<li>6 million people (70% of population) benefit
from improved early warning information
to respond to climate extremes;</li>



<li>10% of the total population (0.8 million
beneficiaries (25% are women) have
increased resilience of food and water
security, health, and well-being in PNG;
and</li>


<li>US$ 1.7 billion value of transport, building
and utility infrastructure and assets is built
and or rehabilitated according to climateresilient
codes and standards.</li></ul>



<h3>NDC Development Process</h3>
<p>The NDC is consistent with the methodologies
used in the preparation and development of
the BUR1 using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.</p>



<p>PNG adopted the baseline method in the
determination of contributions and in compiling
its NDC. Whilst there are existing laws, policies,
measures, and initiatives that will guide actions
going forward, effective implementation will
require structural adjustments to the domestic
regulatory framework, institutional measures,
financing, and additional action (including
projects). Hence, the NDC will be assessed
against the identified baselines, as opposed
to considering the contributions and targets as
“business as usual”.</p>



<p>The NDC has been developed through an extensive process of consultation including
sector-sub technical working groups, three four
day long ‘lockdowns’ that bought together key
technical officers from across key sectors and
four national level consultation meetings that
provided a forum for multi-stakeholder inputs
into the NDC. Targets presented are in line with
key national policies, strategies and plans and
it has been endorsed by the National Executive
Council of PNG.</p>



<p>Within this process there has been a strong
commitment to ensuring a gender responsive
and human rights-based approach, which
will be carried over into all related planning,
programming and implementation. This
includes participation of women, youth and
vulnerable groups in consultations, planning
and decision making in the sectors, as well as
to ensure women and youth have opportunities
to develop sustainable low-carbon livelihoods.</p>


<h3>Consideration of the NDC Being Fair and Ambitious</h3>


<p>PNG’s emissions account to a minimal
percentage of global emissions. The country
is also a lower middle-income country that
faces significant development challenges.
Despite this the GoPNG have made significant
commitments to address the impacts of
climate change, with the proposed targets
considered very ambitious (addressing
sectors responsible for over 38% of PNG’s net
emissions and a far higher percentage should
gross emissions from the LULUCF sector be
considered) when assessed against PNG’s
levels of development, its status as a Small
Island Developing State (SIDS) and its emissions
profile – including projected increases in
emissions. It should also be noted that these
targets mark a stepwise approach to the
development of PNG’s emissions commitments
with ongoing improvements in GHG monitoring
and reporting being undertaken to allow PNG to more effectively develop and set targets for
sectors in which data is currently too limited for
effective target setting.</p>



<p>The inclusion of adaptation within PNG’s targets
presents a clear statement of recognition
that PNG, while only contributing a relatively
insignificant level of emissions, will face some
of the most significant impacts of climate
change. As such support to addressing these
impacts is paramount as part of the global
response to climate change.</p>


<h3>NDC Implementation and Support Needs</h3>


<p>PNG is committed to delivering the targets
presented in this NDC and further enhancing
ambition in future NDCs. Presented targets are
in line with key national and sector policies
and strategies, as well as the emerging
National Adaptation Plan and as such are
fully integrated into PNG’s response to climate
change. PNG will also establish a National
Climate Change Coordination Committee
(NCCCC) that will bring together key sector
agencies and central government bodies to
lead PNG’s response to climate change. This
committee will be supported by the Climate
Change Development Authority (CCDA),
which will continue its mandate to collect
information on emissions and the impacts of
climate change as well as support sectors and
subnational governments in the development
of mitigation and adaptation plans and actions
and their mainstreaming into core workflows.
An NDC Implementation Plan has also been
developed to provide a more detailed outline
of how targets will be achieved and it will be
against this work plan that annual progress will
be monitored. The NDC Implementation Plan
also lays out key projects and programmes
that will require support to ensure that targets
are met.</p>

<h1>Papua New Guinea’s
Enhanced
Nationally Determined
Contribution
2020 (Full Version)<h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Papua New Guinea signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in June 1992
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and became a Party after its ratification in March 1993. On 21st September 2016, PNG
ratified the Paris Agreement in New York during the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. PNG is
also a member of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and aligns itself with the Alliance of the Small Island
Developing States (AOSIS) in the context of the UNFCCC. PNG is the current Chair of the Coalition for Rainforest
Nations (CfRN), engaging in negotiations under the UNFCCC for its 52 member countries, especially on Article 6 of
the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>PNG established the Climate Change and Development Authority (CCDA) under its national Climate Change
Management Act 2015 (CCMA), with the primary role of facilitating and developing appropriate policies, and
regulatory framework to address climate change in the country. The Act is currently under review to ensure that it
can effectively respond to the needs of and PNG’s obligations under the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The Government of PNG (GoPNG) has shown its commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the UNFCCC. This
includes mainstreaming climate change in its development priorities, as captured in the national long-term
political vision, plans, and strategies of; PNG Vision 2050, the National Development Strategic Plan 2010-2030, and
the Medium Term Development Plan III. These strategies are founded on the concepts of helping to strengthen and
diversify the foundations of PNG’s economic growth while taking action to both increase the country’s resilience
to climate change and take steps to further mitigate emissions. The most recent steps in developing these policy
approaches have been the development of PNG’s SDG 13 Climate Action Roadmap as well as the development
of the National REDD+ Strategy (NRS).</p>

<p>The development of PNG’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) aligns with the national strategies noted
above and builds on the first NDC submitted in 2016. This NDC further aligns with sectorial policies, plans, and
strategies that stakeholders will implement in response, existing challenges and circumstances.</p>

<p>PNG’s NDC sets out a comprehensive package of policies and measures, sectorial targets, and sector-specific
actions that are tailored towards meeting defined contributions to addressing climate change through both
immediate action and developing the enabling environment and technical capacity for an ongoing process of
increased ambition. The document is, in compliance with the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) requirements
as stipulated under the Paris Agreement. The contributions outlined in this NDC are all conditional.</p>

<p>The NDC outlines key pathways towards sustainable economic development in line with the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals – in particular, Goal 13 on Climate Action. The central element of this is; maintaining
PNG’s high forest cover (currently reported at 78 percent<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) and reducing emissions from both the AFOLU and Energy
Sectors covering two (2) of the four (4) emitting sectors from PNG’s first Biennial Update Report submitted in 2019.</p>

<p>Adaptation is a high priority due to the climate-related hazards that already pose significant risks to PNG today.
PNG’s commitment to adaptation for 2020-2030 will focus on four priority development sectors of agriculture,
health, transport, and infrastructure. The PNG’s National Adaptation Plan which is due for completion in 2021 will
align with this enhanced NDC.</p>
<p>The commitment here seeks to ensure a gender-responsive and human rights-based approach in all related
planning, programming, and implementation. This includes the participation of men, women, youths, and
vulnerable groups in consultations, planning, decision making and implementation in the identified sectors, as well
as ensuring men, women and youths have opportunities to develop sustainable low-carbon livelihoods.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the
  cornerstones that bind international obligations on climate change globally. The Paris Agreement specifically
  challenges Parties under Article 3 to take robust climate action, through what has become known as the Nationally
  Determined Contributions (NDC). Papua New Guinea (PNG) like all other Parties is required to communicate its
  ambitious targets and report on progression overtime on how PNG through national action is contributing towards
  achieving the long term temperature and adaptation goals set under Article 2 of the Paris Agreement.</p>


<p>  The NDC is an articulation of PNG’s mitigation and adaptation contributions. It sets out targets and identifies
  measures and actions to be pursued towards achieving these targets. It contains five (5) chapters which outline
  the following:</p>
  <ul><li><strong>Chapter 1 (National Context) </strong>provides a general synopsis of PNG, setting out information on the country’s
geography; climate; population; an overview on economic development; an assessment of the impacts
and vulnerabilities; and an outline of key climate change policies, institutions, and regulatory frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 2 (Summary of Information on Clarity, Transparency and Understanding) </strong>establishes the
reference point, period of implementation, methodology, scope and sector coverage, and a summary of
targets.</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 3 (Papua New Guinea’s Mitigation Contribution)</strong> focuses on mitigation targets and potential
actions and measures to be taken in sectors identified: Energy Sectors and LULUCF sub-sector;</li>

<li><strong>Chapter 4 (Papua New Guinea’s Adaptation Actions)</strong> covers adaptation planning, priorities, data gaps,
and outlines the adaptation actions and targets; and:-</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 5 (Means of Implementation) </strong>discusses matters pertaining to implementation. The chapter
contains a needs assessment which covers general support, finances and capacity building.</li></ul>

<h2> National Context </h2>
<h3> Geography & Climate </h3>
<p>PNG is an island country in the South Pacific Region, located between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn.
It shares the international land border with Indonesia to the west, and maritime borders with Australia to the
south, the Solomon Islands to the east, and the Federated States of Micronesia to the north. It has a total land
area of (46.13 million hectares), 97 percent<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> of which is customarily owned by local indigenous people, while
3 percent is alienated land owned by the State.</p>

<p><img src="PNG-NDC2_2.png"/></p>

<p>Owing to its geographical proximity to the northward moving Australian continental plate and the northwest
moving Pacific plate, PNG is located in one of the most tectonically active areas in the world, also known
as the ring of fire. The country is bestowed with remarkable diversity and extraordinary landscapes, terrestrial
ecosystems, rich flora and fauna with accommodating climatic conditions.</p>
<p>PNG’s climate is classified as an ‘Af climate’ according to Koppen –Geiger Classification with hot, humid
tropical climate experienced all year round<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. The country experiences two distinctive seasons: wet and dry
- whereby the wet season occurs from December to March, and the dry season from June to September.
PNG’s average monthly rainfall ranges between 250mm – 350mm, with average temperatures between 26
– 28 degrees Celsius. Humidity is relatively high in PNG, ranging between 70 - 90 percent<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

<h3>Impacts & Vulnerability </h3>
<p>PNG is ranked as the tenth most vulnerable country
in the world to the risk of climate change<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. PNG’s
highlands region is susceptible to extreme weather
such as heavy rainfall, which may increase the
occurrence of landslides and inland flooding. The
coastal regions, the islands and the low-lying atoll
areas are mostly vulnerable to extreme weather
events, storm surge, sea-level rise, and coastal
inundation.</p>
<p>With more than 75 - 80 percent of the population
living in rural areas<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, the risk of exposure to natural
hazards is very high. PNG’s rural populations are
mostly subsistence farmers that rely on subsistence
farming for their livelihoods, with limited capacity to
protect themselves from climate-induced natural
disasters. The rugged mountainous terrain as well
as limited access to basic infrastructures such as
roads and bridges has hindered rural communities
to access health care, education and broader
development opportunities. Women are particularly
vulnerable due to the lack of access to land,
income, credit and other resources. This lack of
access impedes their ability to cope with climate
stresses and disasters.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of PNG’s population is under the
age of 25 years<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. Much of this group experience poverty as a result of lack of access to education
and employment opportunities. The literacy rate for
young men is 67 percent, and for young women,
79 percent<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>. Approximately 28.4 percent of young
people (between the ages of 15-24) are not
employed or otherwise participating in educational
or vocational training opportunities<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>. </p>
<p>PNG’s climate is projected to change as shown in
Table 1 below. According to the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO), there is a high confidence level of different
climate variables increasing over the course of the
21st century.</p>

<p>These projections are expected to raise exposure levels and increased vulnerability to shifting climatic
conditions and will impact the growing population and economic development.</p>

<h3>Population </h3>

<p>According to the PNG’s national population census
2011, the country’s population has grown from 3.8
million in 1990 to 7.3 million. The 2000 and 2011
censuses<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> acknowledged that around 12 percent
of PNG’s population lives in urban areas while the
rest of the population lives in rural communities.
These rural communities maintain traditional village structures and depend on subsistence farming,
supplemented by cash cropping. Thirty nine percent
of the overall population live in the Highlands region,
26 percent in the Momase region, with the Southern
and New Guinea Islands regions totalling 20 percent
and 15 percent of the population respectively.</p>

<h3>Sustainable Economic Development </h3>
<p>Sustainable economic development is a priority
agenda for the Government of Papua New Guinea
(GoPNG), and is reflected as a long-term goal in the
PNG Vision 2050 (Vision 2050), for PNG to be a “Smart,
Wise, Fair, Healthy and Happy Society”. To implement
the Vision 2050, the PNG Development Strategic
Plan 2010-2030 was developed and endorsed
by the National Executive Council (NEC), which
sets out key targets and more detailed strategies.
This serves as the building block to achieving the
requirements of the Vision 2050. To ensure that the
priority pillars of the Vision 2050 are met, a 5-year
plan called the Medium-Term Development Plan
(MTDP) was developed with specific sector targets
and indicators.</p>
<p>PNG is a developing country and has a dual
economy, consisting of both the formal and informal
economy. The formal economy is made up of the
large-scale extractive mining and petroleum sector,
and the primary industries sector including; forestry,
fishing, and commercial agriculture. It employs
15 percent of the total workforce. The informal
economy on the other hand supports 85 percent
of the population through subsistence agriculture<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
and is dominated by women.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of natural resources and
economic growth recorded since 2013, PNG’s
economy faces numerous challenges. The rugged
terrain and the high costs of infrastructure hamper
the exploitation and development of natural
resources, and consequently, the formal and
informal economies which support it. The GoPNG,
with the support of development partners and
investors, aims to pursue economic activities to
realize sustainable economic development.</p>

<h3>Climate Change Policy, Instutions & Reporting History </h3>

<p>Papua New Guinea is a signatory to the UNFCCC
since 13th June 1992 and has been engaged in
international climate change negotiations. PNG
ratified the UNFCCC on 16th March 1993. In 2015,
the Paris Agreement was adopted, and PNG ratified
the agreement on 21st September 2016. In 2016,
PNG enacted the United Nations Paris Agreement
Act 2016, which gives domestic effect to the Paris
Agreement and provides a legal basis under which
the NDC is administered in PNG, together with the
Climate Change Management Act, 2015.<p>
<p>The Climate Change and Development Authority
CCDA is the National Designated Authority that
coordinates all climate change-related matters in
PNG. CCDA is also the focal point to the UNFCCC.
As the coordinating agency, CCDA works in
collaboration with stakeholders, with the objective
of providing a coordination mechanism at the
national and provincial level for research, analysis,
and development of the policy and the legislative
framework to move towards a low carbon economy
and achieving climate-resilient development in the
country.</p>



<p>To comply with the reporting obligations under the
UNFCCC, PNG prepared and submitted its First and
Second National Communication (NC) in 2002
and 2014, respectively. The report captures Papua
New Guinea’s Green House Gas emissions and
removals including the country’s actions to mitigate
and adapt to the effects of climate change. The
Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines were used for the
First NC and Second NC and the categories were
estimated using Tier 1 methods. The 2006 Good
Practice Guidance was also used in the Second NC.</p>



<p>PNG then submitted its First Biennial Update Report
(BUR1) to the UNFCCC in 2019. The BUR1 contains
updated information of PNG’s GHG emissions and
removals as well as mitigation actions and support
received. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines was used
in the BUR1 GHG Inventory and most categories
were estimated using Tier 1 method while certain
categories in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land
Use (AFOLU) and the Waste sector was estimated
using the Tier 2 method. The time series reported in
the GHG Inventory for the BUR1 was 2000 to 2015,
which is an updated version of the Second NC. The BUR1 contains the results achieved by PNG from
reducing emissions from deforestation and forest
degradation and enhancement of forest carbon
stock (REDD+) initiatives in the AFOLU sector as a
Technical Annex. The Third National Communication
(Third NC) and BUR2 are planned to be submitted by
2021 which will provide an update of the Second NC
and BUR1. Further improvement will be needed to
comply with the Enhanced Transparency Framework
(ETF) as per Decision 18/CMA. </p>
<p>PNG submitted its NDC on 24th March 2016 in
which its contributions and pledges were declared
conditional and subject to relevant technical and
funding support made available by the developed
countries through relevant international funding
sources. It proposed that PNG’s main contributions
will come from the existing REDD+ initiatives under
the Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)
sector, and a 100 percent renewable energy target
set for 2030 as well as promotion of energy efficiency
uses in all appliances from the energy sector. The
other important component of the contributions
would be from climate-resilient development in the
country and enhancing adaptation in the livelihood
of the rural population which amounts to 75 – 80
percent<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> of the 8.25 million<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> people in PNG.</p>
<p>PNG’s NDC in 2016 was prepared in line with the
national strategies and plans. The commitments
were adduced from the National Climate
Compatible Development Management Policy
(NCCDMP), under which PNG aspires to reduce its
emission to 50 percent by 2030 and to be carbon
neutral by 2050.</p>


<p>Specific to the forest sector, PNG developed its
National REDD+ Strategy which was approved by
NEC in May 2017. The National REDD+ Strategy
outlines the key action areas across the sectors.
These are addressed further within the section on
LULUCF </p>

<p>PNG’s Forest Reference Level (FRL) was submitted
to the UNFCCC on 15th January 2017 which shows
the historical annual emissions from the LULUCF subsector
of 31,000 Gg CO2 eq per annum, and it
predicts an ongoing increase in the emissions levels
in the sector. However, should there be any reduction below this level; PNG will become eligible for result
based payments (RBP). All four design elements of
the Warsaw Framework (National REDD+ Strategy<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>,
National Forest Monitoring System, SIS and FREL/FRL
were developed with technical assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO). This allowed PNG to prepare a
submission for RBP to the Green Climate Fund (GCF)
and other donor agencies.</p>

<h3>Summary of Emissions and Removals for PNG </h3>
<p>According to the BUR1, the total net Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2015 amounted to 15,193 Gg CO2
eq compared to the emissions in 2000 which was -14,179 Gg CO2 eq. Therefore, PNG went from a net
sink in 2000 to a net source in 2015. Below are emissions from each sector:</p>
<ul><li>
  Energy Sector amounted to 11,806 Gg CO2
  eq in 2015 an increase of 5,532 Gg CO2 eq
  when compared to 2000.</li>
<li> Industrial Process and Product Use amounted
  to 35 Gg CO2 eq in 2015 an increase of 1.4
  Gg CO2 eq when compared to 2000.</li>
  <li> Agriculture sector amounted to 796 Gg CO2
  eq in 2015, an increase of 114 Gg CO2 eq
  when compared with the year 2000.</li>
  <li> Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
  (LULUCF) sector historically acted as a sink. However, the sector has evolved into a
smaller sink over time due to the decrease
in forest lands over time. The net emissions
from the LULUCF sector amounted to 1,716
Gg CO2 eq in 2015 compared to - 21,636
Gg CO2 eq in 2000 which is a total decrease
of removals amounting to 23,370 Gg CO2
eq.</li>
<li>Waste sector amounted to 873 Gg CO2
eq in 2015, an increase of 354 Gg CO2 eq
when compared to 2000.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="PNG-NDC2_3.png"/></p>

<h2>Summary of Information on Clarity, Transparency & Understanding </h2>
<h3>Reference Point </h3>
<p>The current Enhanced NDC utilizes 2015 as the base year for all emission targets with information being
based on PNG’s current Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report for Papua New Guinea of that year.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> The targeted
GHG for this NDC is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).<p>

  <p>No reference point is provided for the Adaptation Targets due to the diverse adaptation interventions at
  different levels of development.</p>
  <h3>Implementation Period </h3>
  <p>The NDC Implementation Period is from 2020 to 2030. This is based on the accompanied decisions to the
Paris Agreement adopted in 2015<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>
<h3>Papua New Guinea’s Nationally Determined
Contribution Institutional Arrangement & Planning
Process</h3>

<p>The Climate Change and Development Authority is the National Designated Authority of Papua New Guinea
that is responsible to implement the Paris Agreement and commitments under the UNFCCC, in close
collaboration with line agencies. CCDA provided a coordination mechanism at the national level for the PNG
Enhanced NDC through existing institutional frameworks and newly created to best support the successful
revision of the NDC.</p>
<p>The coordination by CCDA with Development Partners and Stakeholders is well outlined in Figure 3.</p>

<p><img src="PNG-NDC2_4.png"/></p>


<p>In planning for the revision of the enhanced NDC, CCDA has ensured the following necessary steps
were taken to ensure better coordination through National Consultation and NDC Coordination through
various steps outlined in Figure 4;</p>

  <li>PNG NDC Preparation</li>
  <li>Engagement of NDC Activities in PNG</li>

  <li>NDC Implementation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Development methodology </h3>
<p>The NDC is consistent with the methodologies used in the preparation and development of the BUR1 using
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.</p>

<p>PNG adopted the baseline method in the determination of contributions and in compiling its NDC. Whilst
there are existing laws, policies, measures, and initiatives that will guide actions going forward, effective
implementation will require structural adjustments to the domestic regulatory framework, institutional measures,
financing, and additional action (including projects). Hence, the NDC will be assessed against the identified
baselines, as opposed to considering the contributions and targets as “business as usual”.</p>

<h3>Consideration of NDC being Fair and Ambitious </h3>

<p>PNG’s emissions account for a minimal percentage of global emissions. Despite this, PNG has made
significant commitments to address the impacts of climate change, with the proposed targets considered
to be very ambitious as assessed against PNG’s levels of development, its status as a Small Island Developing
State (SIDS) and its emissions profile.</p>

<p>The NDC is in line with PNG’s Vision 2050 as well as the Climate Compatible Development Management
Policy accords. The policy outlines the government’s commitment, to be 50 percent carbon neutral by 2030,
and be entirely carbon neutral by 2050.</p>

<p>The NDC commits to ensuring gender-responsive and human rights-based approach in all related planning,
programming, and implementation. This includes the participation of women, youth and vulnerable groups
in consultations, planning and decision making in the sectors,as well as to ensure women and youth have
opportunities to develop sustainable low-carbon livelihoods. </p>

<h3>Summary of contributions
including scope and
coverage</h3>

<h4>Mitigation </h4>


<p>Papua New Guinea reported a net emission
in 2015 of 15,193 Gg CO2 eq which is a
significant increase from the -14,179 Gg CO2
eq reported for 2000<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. PNG, therefore, went
from a net sink in 2000 to a net source in 2015.
The increasing trend was due to the reduction
of removals from the AFOLU sector which
decreased from - 20,972 Gg CO2 eq in 2000
to 2,512 Gg CO2 eq in 2015, a decrease of
23,484 Gg CO2 eq<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. The Energy sector also
had an impact on this increasing trend where
emissions increased from 6,274 Gg CO2 eq
in 2000 to 11,806 Gg CO2 eq in 2015, an
increase of 5,532 Gg CO2 eq<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>


<p>Within the AFOLU sector, the LULUCF subsector
was one of the biggest contributors
to GHG emission in PNG accounting for net
emission of -21,654 Gg CO2 eq in 2000 and
1,716 Gg CO2 eq in 2015.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Within the Energy
sector, the Energy industries sub-sector was
the biggest contributor which accounted to
1,023 Gg CO2 eq in 2000 and 4,128 Gg CO2
eq in 2015<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>




<p>As such this Enhanced NDC Focuses on
targets and actions within these two sectors
specifically the LULUCF sub-sector and Energy
Industries sub-sectors, while also noting
opportunities for action within the transport
sub-sector and a commitment to enhance
ambition in the way that PNG collects and
manages data within them and across all
emitting sectors to allow for further refinement
and enhancement of ambition within future
updates.</p>
<p>Key targets within these areas include:</p>

<h5>Energy Sector</h5>

<p>PNG is committing to a headline target of carbon
neutrality within the energy industries sub-sector.
This will be achieved by:</p>


<ul><li>Increasing levels of renewables in the
energy mix for on-grid connection – through
increasing the share of installed capacity
of renewable energy from 30 percent in
2015 to 78 percent in 2030. The target of
100 percent renewable energy by 2030 in
the previous NDC was revised due to the
influence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) into
the energy mix and existing agreements with
Independent Power Producers that extend
beyond 2030.</li>
<li>Reducing energy demand - through
adoption and implementation of Minimum
Energy Performance Standards and
Labelling (MEPSL) Regulations as well as
enhancing public awareness of energy use
and means of reducing energy use.</li>
<li>Establishing a framework for fossil fuel
emission offsetting – PNG remains committed
to an energy transition but also recognizes
that a full transition will take time given
PNG’s complex geographies and dispersed
population as well as a growing economy. As
such a framework for offsetting of emissions
from fossil fuels will be introduced to support
economic incentives for the transition while
also helping to finance domestic naturebased
solutions in particularly reduced
emissions and enhanced removals from the
forest sector.</li>
<li>Enhanced data collection – PNG will
establish a framework for the enhanced data
collection on energy use and associated
emissions to support improved policy and
regulation to manage emissions.</li></ul>

<p>Also, PNG will continue to review appropriate options
and approaches to reduce emissions from the
transport sub-sector.</p>

<h5>LULUCF Sub-sector</h5>
<p>By 2030, the annual emission from deforestation
and forest degradation due to agriculture expansion
and commercial logging will be reduced by 10,000
Gg CO2 eq comparing to 2015 level. This will result
in the LULUCF sub-sector moving from a net GHG
source (1, 176 Gg CO2 eq) in 2015 to net GHG sink
(-8,284 Gg CO2 eq) by 2030 to mitigate emissions
from other sector</p>

<p>This will be achieved by a 25 percent reduction in
both the area of annual deforestation and annual
degradation against 2015 levels (equating to a
reduction of 8,300 ha of annual deforestation and
43,300ha of degradation) as well as an increase in
the areas of forest planted.</p>

<h4>ADAPTATION</h4>
<p>The enhanced NDC will focus on four (4) development
sectors impacted by the nine (9) priority areas. The
development sectors include agriculture, health,
infrastructure, and transport which are in line with
the development of the PNG National Adaptation
Plan. The adaptation targets are measured against
beneficiaries for the agriculture and health sectors,
and the value and number of assets for the transport
and infrastructure sector and are summarized
below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
 100 percent of PNG’s population to benefit
from introduced health measures to respond
to malaria and other climate-sensitive
diseases; </li>
<li> 6 million people (70 percent of the
population) benefit from improved early
warning information to respond to climate
extremes;</li>
<li> 10 percent of the total population (0.8
million beneficiaries (25 percent are women)
have increased resilience of food and water
security, health, and well-being in PNG; and</li>
<li> US$ 1.7 billion value of transport, building
and utility infrastructure and assets is built
and or rehabilitated according to climateresilient
codes and standards.</li></ul>

<h2>PAPUA NEW GUINEA’S MITIGATION
CONTRIBUTION </h2>

<h3>Energy Sector</h3>

<p>The energy sector is the largest net emitting sector
in Papua New Guinea, emitting approximately 87.7
percent of the total emissions (excluding LULUCF)
in 2015. The total emission from the energy sector
in 2015 was 11,806 Gg CO2 eq, which was an
increase of 5,532 Gg CO2 eq (88.2 percent) from
2000<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>. The GHG makeup of the emissions sees
CO2 as 68 percent of the total sector emissions,
CH4 was 31 percent and N2O was 0.4 percent<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>.
This increase in emissions was a result of an increase
in economic activities in the country. To achieve the
mitigation contributions in the energy sector, efforts
will be directed towards the energy industries and
transport sub-sectors that will build on existing policy
directives of the implementing agencies.</p>


<p>Energy industries, manufacturing industries and
construction account for 5,596 (47 percent) Gg CO2
eq in 2015<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> and include emissions from on and offgrid
electricity generation and operation of the LNG
plant. The on-grid generation that is managed by
PNG Power Limited (a state-owned entity) and offgrid
generation is from the minerals and agricultural
industries that produce their own electricity.</p>


<p>The lack of access to reliable and clean energy is
restricting economic development, affecting health,
and constraining access to education, health
and other services in rural areas. Development
of renewable energy small to medium-sized
enterprises (SME), such as small-scale solar power,
can provide green livelihood alternatives to
subsistence agriculture. Access to electricity or
affordable renewable energies will improve the
livelihood of women and young people in particular
through decreased workloads, improved cooking,
processing of food and Non-Timber Forest Products
(NTFPs), increased safety and security from reliable
lighting, engaging in home-based businesses and
educational activities in the evenings, and reducing
air pollution.</p>



<p>The transport sub-sector contributed approximately
2,007 Gg CO2 eq (17 percent) of the total sectoral
emissions in 2015<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>. This sub-sector is a growing source
of emissions, particularly with the expansion of urban
towns and cities, the population contained in these
towns and cities mainly rely on fossil fuel-run vehicles
for commuting. Availability of safe, affordable,
energy-efficient transportation will increase access
to employment, markets, education, health, and
other services. <p>


<p>Other Sectors contributed 459Gg CO2 eq (4 percent)
of the sectoral emissions in 2015<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>, especially from
the residential and commercial buildings. PNG does
not have much experience with energy efficiency in
the residential and commercial building sub-sector;
hence the lack of energy efficiency measures
to date or energy efficiency projects, which may
generate a high return on investments. Thus, energy
efficiency in PNG presents the potential for winwin
results, reducing greenhouse gas emissions
while at the same time providing financial returns
via reduced power bills and improving health and
economic opportunities for citizens.</p>


<p>Remaining emissions from the energy sector in 2015
came from fugitive emissions of oil and natural gas
production which contributed 3,784 Gg CO2 eq (32
percent)<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>. Irrespective of PNG’s efforts in reducing
GHG emissions, PNG stands as a developing
country and the economy relies on oil and natural
gas production. Hence future GHG emissions
are predicted to take place that potentially will
come with the development of oil and natural gas
production.</p>


<p>The GHG information presented above is reflective of
quantitative data uncovered as a result of the BUR1
GHG inventory. Since PNG does not have a National
Energy Balance table, the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) energy balance table was
used to estimate emissions from the energy sector
in the BUR1. While some of the data used to develop
the APEC energy balance table were from actual
sources in PNG, most of the information was based
on estimates. Due to these uncertainties, it was
decided not to include quantified GHG targets
for the energy sector in this NDC. The appropriate
technical and financial support will be necessary to
build the capacity of relevant agencies to manage
and analyze data to enable the setting of GHG
targets in PNG’s forthcoming NDCs.</p>

<h4>Contribution </h4>
<p>PNG is committing to a headline target of carbon neutrality within the energy industries sub-sector. This
will be achieved by:</p>

<h4>Non - GHG Quantitative Targets</h4>
<p>As part of PNG’s energy transition, the country is
targeting a transition in its energy mix in the energy
industries for the share of installed capacity of
renewables from 30 percent in 2015 to 78 percent
in 2030 for on-grid connection managed by PNG
Power Limited. This target is conditional and based
on the availability and timing of international support.
The National Electricity Roll-Out Plan and PNG Power
Limited’s 15-year power development plan were
used to establish this target and will also be used to
monitor the progress of this target.</p>


<p>This target represents a decrease from PNG’s
original target of 100 percent renewable by 2030.
This revision is based on:</p>
<ul><li> Enhanced information on existing and
planned projects and the time lag to
operationalize larger generation projects.</li>
<li>
The expansion of PNG’s LNG sector and
its increased role in electricity generation
– which while allowing for removal of or
avoidance of higher emission energy
sources from the grid do not present a
renewable energy resource.</li></ul>

<h4>Non - GHG Action Based Targets</h4>
<h5>1. Reducing electricity demand through
energy efficiency</h5>
<p>Increased efficiency of energy use will play a key
role in mitigating the growth in PNG’s demand
for energy linked to a growing economy and
population. Central to this approach will be the
adoption and implementation of Minimum Energy Performance Standards and Labelling (MEPSL)
Regulations as well as enhancing public awareness
of energy use and means of reducing energy
use. In-depth work in the areas of building energy
efficiencies such as evaluating the performance of
installed air conditioning and refrigeration systems
and developing recommendations to improve
such systems as retrofits or in industrial energyefficiency
audits and retrofits will require financial
and technical support. The draft MEPSL is intended
to be fully implemented by 2030. Limited data on
existing energy use and potential trends currently
prohibits placing a quantified target on the impact
of these actions.</p>


<h5>2. Fossil fuel off-setting from the energy
industries sub-sector through nature-based
solutions</h5>


<p>PNG remains committed to an energy transition but
also recognizes that a full transition will take time
given PNG’s complex geographies and dispersed
population as well as a growing economy. As such, a
framework for offsetting of emissions from fossil fuels
will be introduced to support economic incentives
for the transition while also helping to finance
domestic nature-based solutions in particular,
reduced emissions and enhanced removals from
the forest sector.</p>

<h5>3. Enhanced data collection</h5>

<p>PNG will establish a framework for enhanced data
collection on energy use and associated emissions
to support improved policy and regulation to
manage emissions.</p>

<h4>Achieving Energy Industries Sub-sector Targets</h4>
<p>The above targets are fully in line with existing
national policy and strategy documents as well as
industry action plans. Key strategies linked to these
targets and central to their achievement include:<ul>
  <li>National Energy Policy 2017 - 2027</li>
<li> The National Electrification Roll-Out Plan</li>
<li> PNG Power 15 Year Power Development Plan</li>
<li> The Medium-Term Development Plan III Key Result Area 2: Goal 2.1 </li>
<li>Papua New Guinea’s Sustainable
Development Goal 13 Roadmap: The four
key energy actions:</li>
<ul><li> Carbon neutral gas and minerals
sector</li>
<li> Renewable-based rural electrification</li>
<li> Resilient, reliable and efficient
electricity grids and efficient </li>
<li> Energy-efficient government and
private sector</li></ul></ul>


<p>Priority renewable energy projects for investment set
out in PNG’s Country Programme for Green Climate
Fund finance</p>

<p>Several major programs are already being
implemented that will contribute to achieving the
targets, and they include:<p>
<ul><li> PNG Electrification Programme</li>
<li> Pawarim Komuniti – PNG Off-grid
Electrification Program</li>
<li> Town Electrification National Program (TEP)</li>
<li> Rural On-grid Electrification Program (ROGEP)</li></ul>



<p>The Climate Change (Management) Act 2015 is
being reviewed to provide a stronger link between
the energy sector and emissions reductions and
to create a framework for improving energy data
collection.</p>


<h4>Potential Energy Measures</h4>
<p>Papua New Guinea aims to further enhance its
ambitions on taking action within the Energy sector.
One of the areas is the transport subsector which
aims to promote clean fuel technology regulations to
set standards for the GHG emissions, and economic
incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles. Actions from the
transport subsector are contained in the National
Transport Strategy, the Medium-Term Transport Plan
II 2019-2022, National Energy Policy 2017-2027,
and National Climate Compatible Development
Management Policy but will need financial and
technical support for them to be implemented by
2030. These measures include the following:</p>

<ul><li>
 Reduce vehicle-miles through more
compact development patterns;</li>
<li> Encourage the introduction of fuel-efficient
transport equipment;</li>
<li> Encourage sustainable substitution of fossil
fuels with biofuels;</li>
<li>Monitor vehicle fleet-weighted fuel and CO2
efficiency;</li>
<li> Eliminate high emission vehicles;</li>
<li> Establish low carbon fuel standards;</li>
<li> Encourage the introduction of hybrid and
electric vehicles</li></ul>

<h3>Land Use, Land-Use Change & Forestry Sub-Sector</h3>


<p>The Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
(LULUCF) sub-sector is one of the biggest contributors
to GHG emissions in PNG. Nevertheless, the sector
also has the highest potential for removal. The sector
has evolved into a smaller sink over time due to a
decrease in forest lands. The net emissions from the
LULUCF sector amounted to 1, 717 Gg CO2 eq in
2015 compared to -21, 636 Gg CO2 eq in 2000
which is a total decrease of removals amounting to
23,370 Gg CO2 eq<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>.</p>


<p>Most of the emissions in the sector occurred as a result
of deforestation and forest degradation. Almost all
deforestation was due to land-use conversion from
forest land to cropland, in particular, subsistence
agriculture (68.8 percent) and for oil palms plantation
development (24.4 percent). Logging was the
major driver of forest degradation, accounting for
over 90 percent of the total degraded forest in PNG.
Hence, the primary mitigation effort of the sector
lies in reducing emission from deforestation and
forest degradation due to commercial agriculture,
subsistence agriculture and commercial logging.</p>


<p>Sustainable forest management practice is
the cornerstone of the current forest policy in
the management and utilization of the nation’s
forest resources. This is now being strengthened
by the approval of several national government
policy instruments in 2020, including; the National
Reforestation and Afforestation Strategies, National
Strategies on Domestic Processing of Forest
Produce, Revised PNG Logging Code of Practice
2nd Edition, and the PNG Timber Legality Standard.
These policy instruments are crucial to facilitating
orderly management and development of the
forest resources, with the view of giving significant
recognition to mitigate against climate change
effects.</p>


<p>The REDD+ Finance and Investment Plan (RFIP) which is integral part of the NDC Implementation Plan
identified areas within the AFOLU sector to mitigate
GHG Emissions . The RFIP sets out the potential
opportunities that scaling up actions in line with
PNG’s National REDD Strategy (NRS) could deliver.
These include emissions reductions of more than 60
million tonnes of CO2e over the coming decade,
while also delivering significant economic, social
and environmental co-benefits. This information
is intended to help inform decision makers and
potential investors of the potential to deliver tangible
returns from upfront investments in REDD+ in PNG.</p>



<p>Progress in the sector is influenced by the following:</p>
<ul><li>coordinated planning on how forest land
can be cleared and utilised in a sustainable
manner;</li>
<li>development and implementation of
legislation to manage forest resources for its
multiple values, and</li>
<li>effective support to rural development.</li> </ul>


<p>Landholders and communities are in need of access
to basic services and development opportunities.
Many communities and landholders are faced with
rapid transition into a global cash-based economy,
without the appropriate awareness, skills, and support
for sustainable management of resources. Hence,
they are indirectly increasing the deforestation and
degradation of the forest cover.</p>



<p>Achievement of proposed action areas in the
enhanced NDC will be critical in helping transform
the livelihoods of PNG’s rural communities, safeguard
biodiversity and progress PNG towards establishing a
sustainable and climate smart economy capable of
meeting the Sustainable Development Goals while
also helping to deliver sustainable deforestation free
agricultural commodities to international markets.</p>


<h4>Contributions</h4>


<p>Papua New Guinea reported the GHG emissions
in the LULUCF sub-sector from 2000 to 2015 in the
country’s BUR1 in 2019<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>. PNG’s emissions in LULUCF
sub-sector have been increasing steadily during the
reporting period due to increases in deforestation
and forest degradation caused predominantly
by the expansion of agriculture and commercial
logging. Actions noted within this NDC will transform
this upward trend into a downward trend over the
next 10 years (by 2030) as shown in Figure 4.</p>



<p>PNG will reduce the area of annual deforestation
and annual degradation by 25 percent against
2015 levels (equating to a reduction of 8,300 ha or
annual deforestation and 43,300ha of degradation),
and increase the area of afforestation, reforestation,
and ecosystem restoration. It will reduce 10,000 Gg
CO2 eq of the net emission from the LULUCF subsector
by 2030.</p>



<p>PNG is a High Forest cover Low Deforestation (HFLD)
country with 78 percent forest cover and average
annual deforestation rate of 0.05 percent between
2001 and 2015<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>. Increase of deforestation and
forest degradation in recent years is largely owing
to the rapid population growth (3.1 percent per
annum) and fast-growing economy (6.7 percent
average annual constant GDP growth between
2009 and 2016)<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>. This trend is expected to continue
as well as the increasing trend of emissions in the
LULUCF sector as shown in Figure 45. PNG will
shift to a downwards trend mainly by promoting REDD+ activities such as enhancement of land use
planning and monitoring, promoting climate-friendly
agriculture, strengthened monitoring of FCA permits,
enhancement of timber legality, and promoting
reforestation and ecosystem restoration. PNG will
continue improving the monitoring capacity of
LULUCF sub-sector by enhancing its National Forest
Monitoring System for more accurate monitoring
of forest and land-use change, and assessment
of GHG emissions in LULUCF sub-sector. The NDC
targets and the activities in the LULUCF sector are
listed in Table 2.</p>




<p>There were no emissions reduction targets set for the
Agriculture sub-sector under the AFOLU sector due
to unavailability of country-specific activity data
and insignificant emission results. However, there
is greater potential for livestock and agriculture
development in the country; as such it will be a
potential sector that will attract mitigation actions in
the future.</p>


<p>The LULUCF GHG and Non-GHG targets are
determined based on the sector’s primary
mitigation efforts as well as capacity needs to
address the sector’s monitoring capacity. There are
options to improve monitoring and accounting to
better address sustainable management of forests
and conservation of forest carbon stocks but current
data does not allow for this, which PNG would like to
improve on in the near future.</p>

<h4>Potential Policies and Measures</h4>
<p>The Papua New Guinea National REDD+ Strategy (2017 - 2027), has identified priority areas and
measures to achieve PNG’s emissions reduction targets, it will require action that cuts across government
sectors and stakeholder groups, at every level (National, Provincial, Local and Ward), which will not halt
economic and social development but ensure responsible and sustainable development and deliver
long term benefits to the people of PNG. The policies and measure needed that will address the direct
and underlying drivers of forest cover change<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> will be based on the following outlined;</p>
<p>
  a) Strengthening Land Use & Development Planning</p>
<p>  The main drivers of emissions are forest degradation
  and deforestation (forest land converted to other
  land use). As logging was the main driver for 90
  percent of forest degradation between 2011- 2015,
  strategies on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation
  and Forest Degradation and Enhancement of
  Carbon Stocks (REDD+) must be implemented
  effectively.</p>
<p>  b) Stronger Environmental Management,
  Protection & Enforcement – Degradation
  Potential</p>
<p>  The action area will be concentrated on the
  development and implementation of a system
  of developing land-use planning that is both
  consistent with and able to promote the concepts
  of StaRS while also supporting the strengthening
  of the development and land use planning
  frameworks. It is intended to secure the importance
  of communities and landholders as the custodians
  of their land, including directing resources to support
  strengthened forest management and protection
  by women and youth.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>  c) Enforce Economic Productive & Sustainable
  Livelihoods</p>
<p>  There is a rapid increase in land clearing for commercial
  agriculture due to the demand for investment in
  rural areas. This is supported by government policies
  that promote agricultural expansion for increasing
  food security and expanding agricultural exports.
  However, this does not link with actions to support
  staple food production within family agriculture or
  clear guidance on the environmental and social
  standards. The NRS, therefore, targets actions to
  strengthen food security and develop a sustainable
  commercial agriculture sector to be able to respond
  to changing international standards.</p>
  <h2>

    4. PAPUA NEW GUINEA’S ADAPTATION
    ACTIONS</h2>

  <p>  Adaptation is a high priority due to the climaterelated
hazards that already pose significant risks to
Papua New Guinea considered highly vulnerable to
the effects of climate change.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> Addressing this high
vulnerability to climate change involves a breadth
of measures,<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>to which adaptation is integral.
PNG’s Second NC describes the extremely exposed
status of this island nation and its vulnerability to the
negative impacts of climate change.</p>




<p>The country’s tropical climate is changing rapidly
and exposure to climate change-related hazards
such as inland flooding, coastal flooding, inland
frosts and droughts, coastal erosion and inundation,
soil salinization, and coral reef degradation have
resulted in a severe toll to both the people of PNG and
the national economy. Climate change is predicted
to exacerbate some of these event-driven hazards
and introduce new hazards due to gradual shifts in
climatic conditions – most prominently, an increase
in malaria penetration into the highlands changed
agricultural yields and further damage to coral reefs.
These event-driven hazards in turn cause damage
to assets and infrastructures, destroy livelihoods,
endanger cultural and ecological treasures, and kill
or injure people.</p>


<p>The GoPNG, through the CCDA, has emphasized
the significance of adaptation through its reporting
on national projects and specific activities. CCDA
also coordinates and monitors projects that support
specific adaptation solutions that protect people
against the risk of climate change. Adapting to the
impacts of climate change is integral to PNG and,
therefore, included in this NDC. Vulnerability and risk
exposure to climate change impacts exacerbate
human development challenges and social issues</p>


<p>The last recorded total net GHG emissions for PNG
were 15,193 Gg CO2 eq; tailored adaptation
measures are necessary to adapt to this climate
change influencing trend into the future.</p>



<p>PNG is one of the countries that mention loss and
damage in terms of finances. According to a
report by the United Nations Office of Disaster, USD
23 million was lost due to the severity and intensity
of disasters occurring between 2005 and 2014. In
terms of adaptation, a 2013 report by the Asian
Development Bank revealed that the annual
adaptation cost ranged between 0.14 percent -1.52
percent of the GDP. The economic cost to climate
change is projected to reach 15.2 percent of GDP
by 2100. Observation from investments made in
climate change adaptation however has seen
positive implications towards climate resilience.</p>
<p>The PNG National Disaster Centre launched the
National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework (NDRRF)
2017-2030, in 2017, with the assistance of the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
This framework comprises of four priority areas:
i) Understanding Disaster Risk; ii) Strengthening
Disaster Risk Governance to Manage Disaster Risk;
iii) Investing in Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience;
and iv) Enhancing Disaster Preparedness for Effective
Response and to “Build Back Better” in Recovery,
Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction.</p>
<p>The addition of adaptation into this Enhanced NDC
builds upon the initial NDC report by expanding on
identified priority areas and including subsections on
adaptation planning, defining adaptation targets
and providing an overview of the implementation
process.</p>

<h3>Adaptation Planning</h3>


<p>Adaptation planning is guided by PNG’s international
agreements, regional commitments, and strategic
framework of national plans designed to meet the
country’s climate change goals in the immediate
to long-term. As a party to the UNFCCC, the Paris
Agreement, and the Sendai Framework, PNG is
ultimately committed to achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals, in particular, Goal
13 on Climate Action.</p>
<p>PNG commenced adaptation planning with its
Initial National Communication (INC) to the UNFCCC
in 2000, followed by its Climate Compatible
Development Strategy in 2010. Regionally, PNG’s
goals are strategically positioned with the Pacific’s
Framework for Resilient Development Plan (FRDP)
confirmed through robust engagement with
regional partners. The adoption of Climate Change
Management Act 2015 and the Paris Agreement
Implementation Act 2016 provide the foundational
legislative framework to guide the adaptation
activities of PNG.<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the Vision 2050, the Development
Strategic Plan (DSP), the Strategy for the Responsible
Development for PNG (STaRs), and the National
Climate Compatible Development Management
Policy (NCCDMP) set a strong foundation for
adaptation planning. PNG takes an inclusive
and responsible and sustainable development
approach to adaptation planning guided by the
21 principles for inclusive green growth outlined in
STaRs. The strategic focus of the GoPNG to address
climate change adaptation is outlined in the
Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP III) 2018-
2022 Goal 7 Key Result Area (KRA) 7.2, which is to
‘adapt to the domestic impacts of climate change
and contribute to global efforts to abate greenhouse
gas emissions.’</p>
<p>The Government has identified twelve overarching
adaptation strategies to help meet its strategic
adaptation focus. One of the strategies is ‘to
establish and strengthen national and sub-national
climate change and development strategies’,
which the Government aims to achieve through
the development of the PNG National Adaptation
Plan (NAP). The NAP aims to advance effective
adaptation planning with an overall objective to
strengthen institutional and technical capacities
and integrate climate change adaptation into
national and sub-national planning and budgeting
processes.</p>

<h3>Adaptation Nine Priority Areas</h3>
<p>This subsection identifies PNG’s priority actions in the face of climate challenges while interlinking them
with the country’s key policy and strategy documents, verified through robust stakeholder engagement
and national validation workshops.
Nine adaptation priority areas have been identified and prioritized in key national documents, including
the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), the Climate Change Management Act of
2015, the National Communications, and the GCF Readiness Support for NAP Project for PNG, the CCDA
Climate Change Corporate Plan, and the GCF PNG Country Programme.
The nine adaptation priority areas influence key priority development sectors and the linkages between
them are summarized below.</p>

<h4>1. Coastal Flooding and Sea Level Rise</h4>
<p>Coastal flooding and sea level rise continue to affect
the coastal regions of Papua New Guinea. The sea
level surrounding PNG has risen by approximately
7mm per year since 1993, which is higher than the
global average of 2.8-3.6mm per year.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Projections
anticipate a continued rise. Under a high emissions
scenario, the sea is expected to rise between 4cm
- 15cm by 2030.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> This will impact storm surges and
flooding to coastal regions.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> Risk of flooding (both
coastal and inland flooding) is ranked amongst the
highest level of climate risks in PNG. Approximately
1 percent of the country’s total landmass is
experiencing flooding.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>


<p>Coastal flooding is anticipated to increase,
particularly in PNG’s northern areas.<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> In rural coastal
lowland areas, mangroves, estuaries and coral reefs
are impacted as a result of the heavy silt and debris
deposited from flood events. Rising sea levels are
having an impact on agricultural crops grown on
coral atolls, including swamp taro and coconut,
where the freshwater lens is being intruded by
saltwater resulting in a loss of production and an
impact on livelihoods<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p>This priority area is linked to the transport, infrastructure,
agriculture, urban development, natural resources
and environment, and water and sanitation sectors.</p>

<h4>2. Inland flooding</h4>

<p>Driven by heavy irregular rainfalls, inland flooding
regularly affects valleys and wetlands in both
the lowlands and the highlands. Most of PNG
experiences flooding during the monsoon season.
This impacts most rural livelihoods, which are highly
reliant on agriculture.<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> As referred to above under
Priority Area 1, the risk of flooding (both coastal and
inland flooding) is ranked amongst the highest level
of climate risks in PNG. Approximately 18 percent
of the country’s total landmass is experiencing
flooding. In August 2017, flooding in the Morobe
Province resulted in 150 homes being swept
away by floodwaters in a single day and 500
people becoming displaced.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>The effects of
inland flooding are amplified by steep inclines
and deforestation. Inland flooding is projected to
increase in wetlands and valleys in highlands and
lowland areas.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> <a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>This priority area is linked to the transport, infrastructure,
agriculture, urban development, and water and
sanitation sectors.</p>

<h4>3. Food Insecurity</h4>
<p>Variability in agricultural yields affects many of
PNG’s agricultural regions. The highland regions are
particularly sensitive to variability in agricultural yields
as a result of a change in climatic conditions. Sweet
potato, coffee and cocoa are examples of climatesensitive
crops. Subsistence farmers are affected the
most and may need to look for alternative crops.</p>
<p>This priority is linked to the agriculture sector.</p>

<h4>4. Cities & Climate Change</h4>
<p>Papua New Guinea is experiencing an increase
in rural to urban migration. Climate change
exacerbates existing urban development challenges
and vulnerabilities, such as poor health, inadequate
housing, and lack of access to infrastructure, basic
services and social safety nets. Urban areas on the
coast are under threat of storm surge and sea-level
rise, and, in PNG, cities are often located in hazardprone
areas in the coastal zone.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>    <a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>

</p>

<p>This priority area is linked to the transport,
infrastructure, health, urban development, and
water and sanitation sectors.</p>


<h4>5. Climate-Induced Migration</h4>

<p>Climate change affects patterns and rates of
internal migration and urbanization within PNG,
particularly for communities residing in climatevulnerable
areas and reliant on natural resources
for livelihoods and well-being. Vulnerabilities faced
by rural communities, exacerbated by climate
change, are a key driver for rural to urban migration
within PNG. The drivers for migration, which are
often aggravated by the impacts of climate change, include access to employment, access
to education, access to health services, access to
socio-cultural networks, access to financial services,
access to telecommunications, and access to clean
water, sanitation and electricity.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>Key hotspots,
where rates of climate change-induced migration
are high, include urban areas, outer islands and
atolls, and coastal, delta and riverine communities,
and communities prone to drought.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> Both the
Manam and the Carteret Islands in PNG have been
impacted by environmental degradation and
climate change hazards, which has resulted in the
displacement of communities from these islands.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
Resettlement of climate-induced migrants will be
complicated by the requirement for access to land
and resources, including the provision of sustainable
livelihoods, housing, infrastructure and public
services such as education and healthcare.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>


<p>This priority area is linked to the transport, health,
education, urban development, and water and
sanitation sectors.</p>





<h4>6. Damage to Coral Reefs</h4>
<p>

  As atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise,
  oceans will warm and continue to acidify.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> Under
  all three emissions scenarios, ocean acidification
  is projected to increase in the waters surrounding
  PNG.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> Data shows that ocean acidification
  around PNG has slowly been increasing since the
  18th century, impacting the growth of corals and
  organisms that require carbonate minerals to
  develop.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> This damage will impact the health and
  viability of PNG’s marine ecosystems, including
  the coral reefs that provide ecosystem services to
  communities.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a> <a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> There are 15 coastal provinces in
  PNG with a population of approximately 4.5 million
  that rely on food, shelter and livelihoods sourced from coral reefs.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> Not only do the reefs contribute
to livelihoods, but also protect the coastlines from
storms and loss of land.</p>

<p>This priority area is linked to the transport,
infrastructure, fisheries, agriculture, natural resources
and environment, and water and sanitation sectors.</p>

<h4>7. Malaria and Vector-borne Diseases</h4>
<p>

  Malaria in PNG is one of the top five health priorities
  presently challenging the health sector<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>. Malaria
  severely affects daily life in PNG, with 1.7m people
  infected every year. About 60 percent of the
  population lives in high-risk malaria regions. Once a
  disease found only in PNG’s low-lying coastal regions,
  over the last 20 years climatic changes resulting in
  rising temperatures have worsened the effects of
  malaria with malaria vector mosquitoes carrying the
  malaria parasite establishing itself in the highlands
  where it was not previously present.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> Migration of
  malaria to densely populated highland regions with
  no immunity is a high risk to the community. Poor
  environmental health management, poor waste
  management and poor water and sanitation
  management provide an environment for increased
  and optimal breeding conditions for malaria
  parasites.</p>
  <p>This priority area is linked to the health, water and
  sanitation sectors.</p>

<h4>8. Water and Sanitation</h4>
<p>PNG’s population is among those with the least
access to safe water supply in the world. The GoPNG’s
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Policy 2015-
2030 indicates that 89 percent of people in urban
areas and 33 percent in rural areas have access to
safe water, while 57 percent of urban dwellers and
only 13 percent of the rural population have access
to basic sanitation.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> Climate change impacts
from coastal and inland flooding and landslides
risk increasing cases of malaria and vector-borne
diseases, as well as contaminating drinking water.</p>

<p>This priority area is linked to the health, natural
resources and environment, and water and
sanitation sectors.</p>

<h4>9. Landslides</h4>

  <p>Triggered by increased rainfall intensity and landuse
  changes in the mountainous rural areas of
  PNG, landslides frequently cause damage to vital
  infrastructure, homes and gardens, and upland
  forests.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> PNG ranks 1st in global landslide hazard
  profiles, according to a World Bank Hotspot study.
  <a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> In recent decades, landslides have caused
  considerable damage to road infrastructure and
  remote communities. Landslides have caused
  significant damage along the Highlands Highway,
  the sole lifeline for the highland communities and
  export businesses. Increases in rainfall and inland
  flooding as a result of climate change will increase
  the likelihood of landslide events.</p>

  <p>
  This priority area is linked to the transport, infrastructure,
  health, natural resources and environment, water
  and sanitation sectors </p>

<h4>Additional Priority Areas</h4>
<p>PNG has determined additional adaptation priority
areas as part of the 2019-2020 regional and sectoral
consultations of the Green Climate Fund Readiness
Support project’s identification of climate change
and investment priorities for the PNG GCF Country
Programme. The additional adaptation priorities
are not recognized under the current Climate
Change Management Act 2015. The additional
adaptation priority areas include Forestry and Land-
Use, Waste, Fisheries, Extractive industries, Biodiversity
and Tourism/Cultural. These priority areas are linked
to the agriculture, health, natural resources, and
environment sector.</p>

<h3>Adaptation Actions</h3>

<p>Papua New Guinea’s adaptation actions comprise
tangible and intangible activities that aim to benefit
targeted populations. These include smallholder
farmers, micro, small and medium-enterprises in
business, community-based organizations, clans,
and villages, with particular focus on the most
vulnerable groups, including women, children,
young persons, the elderly, and people living with
disabilities, members of underprivileged or less
advanced groups, or residents of less advanced
areas.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>This subsection provides information on the key
adaptation actions to address PNG’s abovedescribed
nine priority areas, both supported and
unsupported, relative to the period 2021-2030.
Supported adaptation actions are those that have
been resourced and implemented in PNG by various
stakeholders and partners, at different levels, through
programs and projects. Unsupported actions
have yet to be programmed or implemented.
Unsupported adaptation actions provide entry points
to build upon and implement future adaptation
projects and programs, throughout PNG, at all levels
of development intervention.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>Domestic budget constraints impede the
progress of implementation of unsupported
adaptation initiatives. The external financial and
technical support received by the GoPNG through
development partners to address climate change
adaptation plays an important role in the planning
and implementation of adaptation initiatives at all
levels. As such, over the past few years, efforts have
been made to strengthen institutional and technical
capacity to design and implement adaptation projects to be climate-resilient.</p>
<p>Achieving PNG’s adaptation goals requires the
successful and timely implementation of adaptation
actions, monitoring and regulation. Collective
involvement of institutions creates the enabling
environment to develop and implement effective
adaptation policies. The NDC Implementation Plan
provides guidance (see Annex 1).</p>

  <h3>ADAPTATION DATA GAPS</h3>

  <p>Data to inform climate change adaptation action is limited. Existing adaptation data and adaptation data
gaps are listed against the nine priority areas in Table 4-2 below</p>

<h3>FOUR DEVELOPMENT SECTORS</h3>
<p>PNG conducted sector consultations to develop
its NAP Readiness Support Proposal to the Green
Climate Fund (GCF) in 2017 and 2019 and identified
four key development sectors for the NAP to develop
and implement. The four key development sectors
are agriculture, health, transport and infrastructure.
During 2019 and 2020, PNG conducted regional
and sector consultations to review and re-affirm
its national and sub-national priorities on climate
change. The consultations agreed to prioritize the
four key development sectors to address the nine
adaptation priority areas (Table 4).</p>
<p>The PNG Enhanced NDC 2020-2030 will report
on PNG’s four priority development sectors for
adaptation. Through the process of developing
the NAP, PNG commits to strengthening institutional,
technical, and financial capabilities and integration
of climate change adaptation into planning and
budgeting processes.</p>

<p>In advancing PNG’s National Adaptation Plan
(NAP), climate change is being mainstreamed into
regulatory and policy frameworks to address climate
change adaptation and to increase awareness
amongst key stakeholders at the national and subnational
levels.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> The NAP is being developed with

<h3>ADAPTATION TARGETS</h3>
<p>PNG aims to broaden and sustain the scope of
its NDC to include adaptation in the current and
subsequent NDCs. This subsection establishes a
technical approach to defining PNG’s national
adaptation targets.</p>

<p>PNG recognizes that the more comprehensively
the NDC’s are defined, the better the priorities can
be integrated into development partner operations
and support programs.</p>

<p>The approach for defining PNG’s adaptation targets
was undertaken by conducting a series of surveys
and workshops which included sub-national and
sector vulnerability and adaptation assessments,
data collection, and multi-criteria analysis.
The adaptation targets are measured against
beneficiaries for the agriculture and health sectors,
and the value and number of assets for the transport
and infrastructure sector. The adaptation targets for
the four NAP development sector are provided in
Table 6.</p>

<h3>IMPLEMENTATION OF ADAPTATION TARGETS</h3>

<p>Section 4 of the NDC Implementation Plan (Annex)
outlines PNG’s Implementation Plan on adaptation).
The Implementation Plan sets out the strategic
adaptation outcomes that will be achieved by
Government’s twelve overarching adaptation
strategies and objectives. The development of the
NAP is one of the Government’s key objectives,
which will ultimately direct the implementation and
delivery of PNG’s adaptation actions.</p>


<p>The NAP will have in place short-, medium- and
long-term targets to achieve the outcomes of its key
priority development sectors of agriculture, health,
transport and infrastructure. The NAP will include
a list of implementing measures and establish mechanisms for coordination amongst Government
agencies and national stakeholders with activities to
generate the necessary investment and financing
strategy to implement the adaptation plans at all
development intervention levels. </p>

<h2>MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p>Papua New Guinea is fully committed to taking action on climate change. The targets identified within the
NDC are fully in line with existing policy documents and commitments. As such the GoPNG will take a central
role within the implementation of proposed actions while also working to create a positive environment for
private sector investment and partnerships with other parties to the convention.</p>

<p>To commit to reducing GHG emission levels and to increase climate resilience, PNG will require the
appropriate financial support, technology, capacity building, and a good means of coordination to drive
the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions, as outlined in the implementation plan.</p>


<p><em>PNG’s NDC Implementation Plan is a living document and will be updated annually. It is annexed to the
NDC and lists key actions and activities, and the respective resource requirements for each to ensure
successful implementation.</em></p>

<h3>INFORMATION ON FINANCE</h3>

<p>The projects and programs in the Implementation Plan outline the financial resources needed for
implementation.</p>
<p>Technology transfer and capacity development cannot take place without sufficient financial resources
made available to meet the targets. As a Small Island Developing State that is vulnerable to the impact of
climate change, it is important to find the right balance in building the country’s resilience, and implementing
the necessary adaptation and mitigation measures, while supporting the day to day needs of the country.</p>
<p>Implementing the proposed actions could deliver significant emissions reductions that could be monetised
through results based payments under a range of mechanisms including the Green Climate Fund, bilateral,
market or non-market mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and PNG is looking forward to
enforcement of the Article 6 on the ground.</p>


<h3>INFORMATION ON TECHNOLOGY</h3>

<p>A Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) must be
conducted (if not yet carried out), which will clearly
set out the specific needs of the identified sectors .</p>
<p>The need for innovation is crucial to ensure more
efficient and cleaner technologies. The availability
and transfer of technology that is environmentally
sound and which support low carbon and climate-resilient
development are paramount. As a SIDS
these opportunities are not often readily accessible,
hence the need for external support.</p>

<p>A TNA for the NDC needs to be carried out with
relevant stakeholders at the national level. The TNA
ought to be gender-responsive and should consider
the local context.</p>


<h3>GENDER AND YOUTHS</h3>
<p>Women in Papua New Guinea tend to rank well below
men in almost all measures of health, education,
employment, access to economic resources,
and political voice. They make extensive use of
forest resources for food, fuelwood, medicine and
handicrafts. Resource use is gendered in that in most
PNG societies women have use rights to cultivate
the land, gather forest products and to fish for or
collect marine and riverine resources. Regardless
of whether they are members of matrilineal or
patrilineal societies, women cannot enforce rights
to land and property nor claim income from cash
crops or land leases such as for mining, logging and
infrastructure construction.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a> Subsistence agriculture
in the informal economy supports 80 percent of the
PNG population, a sector dominated by women <a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>
(DPNM, 2020). Women are particularly vulnerable to
climate change impacts due to reliance on natural
resources for their livelihoods and household wellbeing,
lack of access to land, income, credit and
other resources.

</p><p>
Sixty percent of PNG’s population is under 25
years old, and they have limited education and
employment opportunities. They are involved in
environmental efforts at the local level, both through
local Youth Councils that are linked to the National
Youth Commission, as well as in non-governmental
activities in conservation, tree planting, and other
forms of environmental activism. It is important
to ensure that youth have the resources and
opportunities they need to develop low-carbon,
environmentally sustainable businesses. They also
need support in their environmental conservation
activities such as tree planting and forest
management.</p>


<p>Eighty-five percent of the population use fuelwood
on at least an occasional basis for domestic and
commercial cooking, even in urban areas. Rural
women in Papua Guinea experience energy poverty
differently than men. With effects on workload and
health, due to distance travelled to collect biomass,
safety concerns when travelling long distances,
reliance on food that requires short or no cooking
time; and indoor air pollution.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a></p>


<p>Women and youth play an important role in
management and production in forest lands,
although they are not landholders. While they have use rights, women rarely have ownership rights
over productive resources. When customary land
rights are negotiated, women tend not to have the
right to claim a direct share of leases, royalties or
compensation payment<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. The primary objectives
of women’s access to forests are to meet household
needs for fuel, fodder, medicinal needs; however,
once these needs are met, they become important
vehicles through which income-generating
opportunities and enterprises can be developed<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Given the importance of sustainable development
of these resources, it will be important to work with
local communities, youth and women to implement
sustainable agricultural and agroforestry practices.
Potential approaches include promoting sociallyinclusive
climate-friendly agriculture; promoting
women’s access to resources, information, and
climate-smart technologies; enhancing the role of
women and youth in agricultural value chains; and
promoting inclusive forest rehabilitation and timber
management.</p>


<p>Subsistence agriculture in the informal economy supports 80 percent of the PNG population, a sector
dominated by women<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 50 percent
of the female labour force in Papua New Guinea is engaged in agriculture, and women comprise nearly 35
percent of the economically active population in the sector. Rural women play a prominent role in subsistence
food production, agricultural value chains and rural livelihoods. They actively participate in livestock and
poultry production and in fish farming and sell surplus produce to generate income for the household.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a>
Increasing rates of migration to urban centres by young people<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>, the movement of men to the logging and
extraction industries for employment, and women’s consistent exclusion from employment in these sectors
(FAO, 2019), mean that women will continue to make up at least half of agricultural producers in the country.
Women are also responsible for family and child health, including water and sanitation management.</p>


<p>Actions should also take into account the gender digital gap and differing access rates of youth and remote
communities to information and early warning systems (see GSMA, 2020 and Mehrabi et al, 2020).</p>

<h2>Annex
to PNG’s Nationally Determined
Contributions:Papua New Guinea
NDC Implementation Plan
2021 - 2030
(A Living Document)</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This Implementation Plan outlines the mitigation
actions/activities that will be undertaken to achieve
the emission reduction targets in the AFOLU and
Energy Sectors, and the priority measures for
Adaptation that have been listed in PNG’s NDC. The
targets, as provided in the NDC, are summarized
below:</p>
<ul><li>AFOLU: PNG aims to reduce an estimated
emission of 10,000 GgCO2eq by 2030 from
deforestation and forest degradation due
to commercial agriculture expansion and
commercial logging.</li>
<li>Energy: PNG will work towards a carbon neutral
energy industries sub-sector by 2030</li>
<li> Adaptation: to identify and implement
adaptation actions aimed at reducing
vulnerability and building climate resilience
across different parts of the country.</li></ul>


<p>In determining the necessary actions to be taken,
the Sub-Technical Working Groups (STWG’s) identified
existing national policies, strategies and plans, and
developed the measures to ensure alignment
with these existing efforts. A detailed narration is
contained in the NDC.</p>


<h4>OVERVIEW OF THE
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h4>

<p>The Implementation Plan seeks to address the five
key modules: Mitigation; Adaptation; Governance;
Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV);
and finance. These are set out in Implementation
Schedules below. Elements of the Finance module
have been incorporated into each of the other four
modules.</p>
<p>The Implementation Schedules are designed to
clearly outline the activities, and their respective
operational elements to guide implementation.
The Implementation Schedules set out the following
information, as they relate to the specific reported
sector targets:</p>
<ul><li> the activity/action that will be introduced, or
enhanced, relative to the established target;</li>
<li> the indicators that will be used to track progress
during implementation, and for monitoring
and evaluation;</li>

<li> listing of the lead and supporting government
agencies;</li>
<li>timeframes, including the start/end dates for
each of the activities; and</li>
<li>the budget estimates for each activity, and
sources of funding, including potential sources
of funding.</li></ul>

<p>

  The Climate Change & Development Authority
(CCDA) as the mandated authority responsible for
coordination of climate change initiatives of the
Government, and acting as the focal point to the
UNFCCC, will collaborate with key stakeholders to
ensure fulfillment of the implementation plan.</p>


<p>The implementation plan will be supported
with an Intra-Governmental Memorandum of
Understanding on the Implementation of PNG’s
Nationally Determined Contribution (MOU) that will,
among other things, formalize the commitment
of the implementing agencies and establish a
platform for dialogue. Further activities identified
include a review of the existing and legislative and
regulatory framework to support the mitigation and
adaptation targets.</p>


<p>In order to monitor implementation of the activities
listed in the Implementation Schedules, the
mechanism for monitoring will be based on the MRV
Framework. The Implementation Plan obligates the
implementing agencies to furnish regular reports;
and a final evaluation report due in 2024.</p>

<h4>PLANNING PROCESS</h4>
<p>
This Implementation Plan was developed in tandem
with the NDC, using the following process:<p>
  <ol><li>
Identifying team leads within CCDA, who
were responsible for the gathering of data
through the Technical Working Groups in the
two mitigation reporting sectors (AFOLU and
Energy), and adaptation;</li>
<li> Review and analysis of the data;</li>
<li>Determination of mitigation and adaptation
targets in the NDC;</li>
<li> Identification of action items and activities that
will be implemented towards the achievement
of the respective targets; and</li>
<li> Validation workshop with key stakeholders.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Mitigation</h5>

<p>The Enhanced NDC covers two (2) of the five emitting sectors , as identified in PNG’s most recent GHG Inventory: AFOLU & Energy . Taken together, the two sectors contributed to a total net of
13,522 Gg CO2-e of the total net emissions of the 2015 net of 15,192 Gg CO2-eq.</p>

<h3>GOVERNANCE & MRV</h3>

<p>The governance and MRV actions and activities will
be pursued to develop the necessary regulatory
and legal infrastructure to support the NDC
implementation, and to build institutional capacity,
to among other things, enhance MRV capabilities.
The Climate Change and Development Authority
(CCDA) is mandated under the Climate Change
(Management) Act 2015 with the responsibility
to contribute toward global efforts in mitigating
greenhouse gas emissions, through low carbon
development that fosters economic growth and
social welfare for the people’s wellbeing and
prosperity. The agency is the National Designated
Authority that coordinates all climate change
related matters in PNG as well as the focal point to
the UNFCCC. CCDA works in collaboration with line
agencies with an objective to provide a coordination
mechanism at the national level.</p>

<h4>Technical Working Committee;</h4>

<p>CCDA</p>
<ul><li>
 communicates and coordinates actions to
achieve outcomes and activities outlined in
the implementation plan</li>
<li>Ensures relevant MRV data needs are
conveyed with the appropriate government
agencies</li>
<li>Review and amend the Implementation Plan
as deemed necessary</li></ul>

<h4>Government Ministerial Committee;</h4>
<ul><li>
Provide high level policy guidance</li>
<li>Highlight, approve updates on the roadmap</li></ul>


<p><img src="PNG-NDC2_6.png"/></p>

<p><em>The Implementation Plan Roadmap the will be developed by March 2021 will detail the Implementation
Schedule of each activity in this Implementation Plan.</em><p>


<h3>Monitoring and evaluation</h3>

<p>Implementation will be monitored and evaluated based on the MRV framework. The table below describes
the specific intervals of the reporting periods, and the institutions required to reporting.</p>

<table><tbody>
  <tr><td><strong>Action</strong></td>
  <td><strong>Timing</strong></td>
<td><strong>Responsible agencies</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>Status update for each activity</td>
<td>Biennially</td>
<td>Implementing government
agencies and supporting
development partners</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>Progress report</td>
<td>Bi-annual</td>
<td>CCDA, implementing agencies,
and stakeholders.</td>
</tr>


<tr><td>Annual report</td>
<td>By December 2021,
December 2022 and
December 2023.</td>
<td>CCDA, implementing agencies,
and stakeholders.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>Interim Evaluation Report</td>
<td>January 2024</td>
<td>CCDA, implementing agencies,
and stakeholders.</td>
</tr>



<tr><td>Final evaluation Report</td>
<td>January 2030</td>
<td>CCDA, implementing agencies,
and stakeholders.</td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>A biennial update report shall be submitted by implementing government agencies and/or development
partners supporting the implementation of these actions. These are submitted to CCDA, who will then be
responsible to compile these status updates into a bi-annual progress report to be shared with stakeholders
and an annual report submitted to Cabinet Ministers. At the end of the implementation period for the NDC
Implementation Plan 2021-2030, a final evaluation report should be prepared by CCDA.</p>
