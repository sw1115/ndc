  <h1> Tonga's Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) </h1>
  <p> December 2020 </p>
<h2><strong>Foreword</strong></h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Tonga is a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) with a population of just over 100,000 people and as such our total contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is negligible, especially when compared to countries with far larger and more developed economies. Nevertheless, Tonga is prepared to do its part and be an example of what we are asking from the rest of the world in terms of climate action. We are convinced that Tonga’s development, need not come at the cost of our own natural environment nor of the livelihoods of future generations and we call for all countries to take the same decisive action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Critical to achieving the 1.5 °C goal of the Paris Agreement is the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country, which articulates efforts by each country to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Tonga is proud to be amongst the countries submitting its second NDC in 2020, as agreed under the timeline set by the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.</p>
<p>This year, more than ever, it is time for every country to double-down on its climate change commitments and support the full implementation of the Paris Agreement to spare our planet from the worst effects of a future in a changing climate. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts it has had on Tonga’s people and livelihoods, Tonga has increased its ambition to cut greenhouse gas emissions in our 2020 NDC and has laid out clear means to implement the targets that have been set, as well as providing the information required for clarity, transparency and accountability of our NDC.</p>
<p>Tonga is already and will continue to be heavily impacted by climate change, including changes in temperatures, shifts in rainfall patterns, rise in sea levels, ocean acidification, and the occurrence of tropical cyclones There is no doubt that climate change is already affecting Tonga’s development, the livelihood of its people and the possible futures for our nation. While Tonga will continue to invest large portions of its public finance and service capacity in the ambitious quest to achieve our climate mitigation and resilience objectives, achieving the targets set out in Tonga’s 2020 NDC will require considerable support for financing, capacity and technology investment from external sources. Tonga will continue to do its part while counting on the support of all nations and our partners around the world.</p>
<p>As the Minister of Meteorology, Energy, Information, Disaster Management, Environment, Climate Change and Communications (MEIDECC), it is indeed an honour and a privilege to submit Tonga’s 2020 Nationally Determined Contribution.</p>
<p><strong>HONOURABLE POASI TEI</strong></p>

<h2 id="key-messages"><strong>Key Messages</strong> </h2>
<p>The Kingdom of Tonga (Tonga) is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change due to its geographic location, status as a SIDS, and the importance of natural resources to its main economic sectors of fisheries, agriculture and tourism. The World Risk Report 2017 has ranked Tonga as the second most at-risk country in the world for natural hazards, including cyclones and flooding, as well as sea level rise. Although Tonga makes a negligible contribution to global GHG emissions, there is no doubt that climate change is already affecting Tonga’s development and the livelihood of its people and future.</p>
<p>The impact of climate change induced phenomena such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, temperature rise and increased intensity of cyclones continue to pose a threat to the people of Tonga, its society, livelihoods, and its natural environment. Irreversible loss and damage from extreme weather events and coastal erosions are putting the Government’s poverty alleviation commitments and national development objectives at risk, and this risk is now compounded by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>According to Tonga’s Third National Communication (TNC) to the United Nation Framework Convention Climate Change, Tonga emitted a total of 310.4 Gg of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent in 2006, with the Energy sector accounting for 39%, Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) accounting for 61%, and Waste accounting for 0.3% of total GHG emissions. Taking into account its negligible emissions and limited resources, as well as the ongoing disruption and uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, Tonga’s second NDC is nevertheless ambitious and reflects the urgency of the Paris Agreement. Tonga’s targets for mitigation are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: 13% (16 Gg) reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2006 through a transition to 70% renewable electricity as well as energy efficiency measures.</li>
<li><strong>AFOLU</strong>: establishment of a forest inventory as prerequisite to identify a GHG emission target for the 2025 NDC and planting one million trees by 2023.</li>
<li><strong>Waste</strong>: expansion of the formal waste collection system as prerequisite to identify a GHG emission target for the 2025 NDC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change within this NDC focusses on coping with the impacts of an increase in temperature and a rise in sea level. In the context of adaptation, the Government of Tonga has set three targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% of land in Tonga utilized for agro-forestry or forestry by 2025, </li>
<li>Prevent any permanent loss of land to rising sea levels on Tonga’s four main islands (i.e. Tongatapu, Ha’apai, Vava’u, and ‘Eua),</li>
<li>Maintenance of the existing stocks of fish and other marine species through a commitment to expand the area covered by Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Special Management Areas (SMAs) to 30% of the Tonga’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, Tonga is currently developing a Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) which will be submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
</ol>
<p>The Government of Tonga (GoT) developed its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) and submitted it to the UNFCCC in 2015 and ratified the Paris Agreement on 21<sup>st</sup> September 2016. When the Paris Agreement came into force on 4<sup>th</sup> November 2016, Tonga’s INDC submitted in 2015 automatically became Tonga’s first NDC.</p>
<p>In accordance with decision 1/CP.21, Tonga hereby communicates its 2020 NDC, its second NDC towards achieving the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as set out in its Article 2, as well as accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency, and understanding of its NDC.</p>
<p>The process to develop Tonga’s 2020 NDC included a review of the 2015 INDC, determining the progress made to date towards achieving its targets and identifying recommendations for the formulation of the 2020 NDC. The review and the recommendations were informed by data sets, academic studies, policies, strategies, roadmaps and other reports and structured interviews with stakeholders in Tonga. The review and recommendations were discussed, comments were received and integrated, and the findings were validated by the Tonga JNAP technical team and relevant stakeholders through national workshops. The 2020 NDC was then prepared building on the recommendations which had been developed and was taken through a final validation process with the JNAP technical team and national stakeholders. The 2020 NDC was then approved by the Tongan Cabinet.</p>
<p>Tonga’s second NDC is aligned with other international conventions and agreements that Tonga is a party to, including but not limited to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> and the Montreal Protocol.</p>
<h2 id="national-circumstances"><strong>2. National Circumstances</strong> </h2>
<h3 id="geographical-characteristics">2.1 Geographical characteristics </h3>
<p>Tonga has four main island groups extended over a south to north axis. Tongatapu (260 km<sup>2</sup>) and ‘Eua (87 km<sup>2</sup>) in the south, Ha‘apai (109 km<sup>2</sup>) in the middle, Vava‘u (121 km<sup>2</sup>) in the north and Niuafo‘ou (15 km<sup>2</sup>) and Niuatoputapu (71.7 km<sup>2</sup>) in the far north. Nuku‘alofa is the capital of Tonga, which is located in the main island of Tongatapu.</p>
<h3 id="climate-profile">2.2 Climate profile </h3>
<p>Tonga’s tropical climate reflects its position within the southeast trade wind zone of the South Pacific. Tonga’s climate is tropical throughout the year, with two distinct seasons: namely dry season (May- October) and wet season (NovemberApril). The northern islands of Tonga receive more rainfall than the southern islands.</p>
<p>The driest month is July, and the wettest month is March. During the dry season, the rainfall level received ranges from 100.53 mm to 145.87 mm/decade while the maximum and minimum temperature varies from 24.7°C to 28.1°C/decade and from 14.71°C to 22.33°C/decade respectively. The wet season is summertime in Tonga, where the rainfall level varies from 140.85 mm to 235.73 mm/decade while the maximum and minimum temperature varies from 27.6°C to 30.3°C/decade, 20.78°C to 24.34°C/decade respectively.</p>
<p>In terms of winds, the southeast trades dominate Tonga. The strength of winds is normally light to moderate with a wind speed of 10 to 16 knots at a distance of 7 to 9 km per hour which is strongly correlated to Tonga’s Southeast trade winds. During dry season, the wind speed is strong in the northern islands of Tonga with little variation in the southern islands. During the wet season, which is summertime in Tonga, tropical cyclones can bring very strong winds at a speed of 22 to more than 65 knots. Tropical cyclones have become more intense than historical records of cyclone occurrences.</p>
<p>The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a significant role in Tonga's climatic patterns. ENSO is associated with large year-to-year changes in the risks of drought, flood, tropical cyclones and coral bleaching throughout the region. Water temperature continues to increase by 0.0004°C since 1993. Sea level rise has also increased by 0.007 m per year since 1993.</p>
<p>Climate determines the state of natural resources such as water, forest, biodiversity and other sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, tourism and health. Henceforth, Tonga is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<h3 id="environmental-resources">2.3 Environmental resources </h3>
<p>Natural resources are the primary source of living for the people of Tonga. Despite being highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, natural resources are also affected by population growth and environment degradation. Forest area covers 12.5% of the lands while 43.1% is by agricultural land and 44.4% by settlement areas including roads and other transportation features, barren land/wasteland, and other construction purposes. Captured rainwater and underground aquifers are the main sources of water resources in Tonga. Water is used daily for household usage, industrial, agricultural, and commercial purposes. These uses put pressure on water resources and are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. The quality and quantity of surface water can be affected by human activities and climate change. Warmer temperature is affecting the water cycle resulting on changes of the amount of rainfall during cyclone season. The demands for water in Tonga are very high as all Tongans need water to maintain health and other economic activities.</p>
<h3 id="population-profile">2.4 Population profile </h3>
<p>The total population of Tonga is about 100,651 as of 2016 (Department of Statistics Tonga, 2016) with 50,255 males and 50,396 females. Tongatapu remains the most populated island in the archipelago, followed by Vava‘u, Ha‘apai, ‘Eua, Niuatoputapu then Niuafo‘ou. The population decreased by 2.5% from 2011 to 2016 and this is largely due to emigration. Census data also showed that the populations of the outer islands in Tonga have also decreased with many people migrating to the main islands for education and other purposes.</p>
<p>Tonga has a relatively young population, with a median age of 22 years. More than one third (39%) of the population is aged 15 years and younger, while only 9% are 60 years and older. Tongatapu’s population was 74,611, constituting 74% of Tonga’s total population. This has increased from 73% in 2011. The urban population of Tongatapu was 23,221 (23% of the total population). The average population density was 155 people per km<sup>2</sup>. However, this varies widely across island division and districts, with the population density in Tongatapu being 286 people per km<sup>2</sup> compared to only 17 people per km<sup>2</sup> in the Niuas.</p>
<h3 id="socio-economic-background">2.5 Socio-economic background </h3>
<p>The key economic sectors in Tonga are agriculture, fisheries and tourism. Remittances to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio in 2015 was 26.5%, which shows the importance of remittances in the economy of Tonga, whereas, exports to GDP ratio was 3.3% in the same year<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is around 4.3 thousand US dollars<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Tonga is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuel to meet energy demand. The use of renewable energy is increasing but is dependent on external funding and technical support. According to Asian Development Bank (ADB) (2019) the total unemployment rate is 1.1 %, with the female unemployment rate at 2 %, higher than the male unemployment rate at 0.5 %. About 11% of the population aged 15 and older in rural areas are subsistence workers compared with only 1% of the population aged 15 and older in urban areas. 22.1% of the population in Tonga in 2015 lived under the national poverty line. Tonga’s Human Development Index (HDI) in 2015 was 0.721, slightly higher than 0.7, the average of developing countries in the same year.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation"><strong>3. Mitigation</strong> </h2>
<p>According to Tonga’s TNC to the UNFCCC, Tonga emitted a total of 310.4 Gg of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent in 2006, with the Energy sector accounting for 39%, AFOLU accounting for 61%, and Waste accounting for 0.3% of total GHG emissions. However, uncertainty in land use data, combined with paucity of information regarding assumptions and methodologies used to calculate GHG emissions and carbon sequestration from living biomass undermines the reliability of the estimate for the AFOLU sector.</p>
<p>Tonga wishes to communicate the following targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions (table 1):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: 13% (16 Gg) reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2006,</li>
<li><strong>Industrial processes and product use (IPPU)</strong>: no target,</li>
<li><strong>AFOLU</strong>: non-emission targets of establishing a forest inventory as prerequisite to identify a GHG emission target for the 2025 NDC and planting one million trees by 2023,</li>
<li><strong>Waste</strong>: non-emission target of expanding the formal waste collection system as prerequisite to identify a GHG emission target for the 2025 NDC.</li>

<h3 id="energy-sector">3.1 Energy Sector </h3>
<h4 id="targets">3.1.1 Targets </h4>
<p>Tonga set the target of reducing GHG emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels by 13% (16 Gg) by 2030 compared to 2006. This target is to be achieved by implementing the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% of electricity generated from renewable sources,</li>
<li>2% efficiency gain per year for newly purchased light duty vehicles</li>

<li>   Limit growth in grid-connected residential electricity end-use to 1% per year on average for the period 2021-2030 by adopting minimum energy performance standards for appliances, lighting, and electrical equipment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overview-of-measures-and-requirements-to-achieve-targets">3.1.2 Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets </h4>
<p>First, generating 70% of electricity from renewable sources requires considerable expansion of generation capacity from solar and wind as well as a substantial increase in battery storage and upgrading of the existing network infrastructure. Technology transfer, capacity building and external financial support will be required to build, operate, and maintain the necessary infrastructure.</p>
<p>Second, achieving a 2% efficiency gain per year for newly purchased light duty vehicles either requires establishing mandatory vehicle standards and/or incentives for purchasing more efficient vehicles through taxes, fees, or import tariffs. While price incentives would likely directly affect consumer choices, mandatory standards would profit from being aligned with price signals for consumers in order to be effective. Establishing mandatory standards and price incentives will require public acceptance as both will likely have an impact on vehicle prices and/or vehicle size.</p>
<p>Third, limiting growth in grid-connected residential electricity end-use to 1% per year on average for the period 2021-2030 may be achieved by adopting minimum energy performance standards for appliances, lighting, and electrical equipment. The successful adoption of energy performance standards will require public acceptance as their introduction will likely increase purchasing prices, though possibly reducing electricity costs. For both vehicle and appliance standards and incentives, technology transfer, capacity building and external financial support may be required.</p>
<h3 id="industrial-processes-and-product-use-ippu-sector">3.2 Industrial processes and product use (IPPU) Sector </h3>
<p>Tonga does not have any target to reduce GHG emissions from IPPU for two reasons. First, GHG emissions from IPPU represent a fraction of Tonga’s total greenhouse gas emissions given the absence of mineral, chemical, metal, electronics, and other manufacturing industries as well as the limited use of lubricants, paraffin waxes and solvents. Second, the paucity of data on GHG emissions from IPPU prevents the establishment of a verifiable target.</p>
<h3 id="agriculture-forestry-and-other-land-use-afolu-sector">3.3 Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) Sector </h3>
<h4 id="targets-1">3.3.1 Targets </h4>
<p>Tonga set two non-emission targets for AFOLU:</p>
<ul>
<li>establishing a forest inventory by 2025</li>
<li>planting one million trees by 2023.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overview-of-measures-and-requirements-to-achieve-targets-1">3.3.2 Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets </h4>
<p>First, while not reducing GHG emissions, the establishment of forest inventory will improve clarity and transparency for the AFOLU sector, providing a basis for the calculation of GHG emissions and carbon sequestration from forests and other woody biomass. Such an inventory will serve as the foundation for quantifying GHG emissions from the sector and identifying a GHG emission target for the 2025 NDC. Currently, the paucity of reliable data leads to significant uncertainty in any attempt to quantify GHG emissions and carbon sequestration from forests and other woody biomass.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The establishment of such a forest inventory requires financing and the development of the necessary technical capacity within the administration to maintain the inventory.</p>
<p>Second, the successful achievement of planting one million trees will reduce GHG emissions. However, it is not possible to quantify this target in terms of GHG emission reductions, as the volume of reductions will depend on the kind and the age of trees to be planted. Successfully planting one million trees will require technical expertise, financial support, and consent from various stakeholders in order to determine what kind of trees will be planted, the land on which the trees will be planted, and who will be responsible for planting the trees.</p>
<h3 id="waste-sector">3.4 Waste Sector </h3>
<h4 id="targets-2">3.3.1 Targets </h4>
<p>Tonga set a non-emission target for the waste sector of expanding the formal waste collection system, including the collection of relevant data on waste amounts and waste composition, as a prerequisite to identify a GHG emissions target for the sector in the 2025 NDC. Expanding the country’s formal waste collection system will also allow to improve transparency and clarity regarding assumptions and methodologies used to calculate GHG emissions from waste.</p>
<h4 id="targets-2">3.3.2 Overview of measures and requirements to achieve targets  </h4>

<p>The expansion of the formal waste collection systems requires financing and the development of the necessary technical capacity within the Waste Authority and the administration to collect the relevant data in order to determine GHG emissions from waste and identify a quantifiable target for reducing GHG emissions.</p>
<h2 id="adaptation"><strong>4. Adaptation</strong> </h2>
<h3 id="priorities-and-objectives-for-adaptation">4.1 Priorities and objectives for adaptation </h3>
<p>In Tonga, adapting to the adverse impacts of climate change focusses on coping with the impacts of an increase in temperature and a rise in sea level. Adapting to the impacts of these two phenomena is regarded as a priority for two reasons. First, there is a high confidence in the available scientific evidence that these two phenomena are a direct manifestation of climate change in Tonga. There is considerable uncertainty about the relationship between climate change and other phenomena, including changes in rainfall patterns, occurrence of droughts, and occurrence of tropical cyclones. Second, there are feasible measures available to respond to the impact of increasing temperatures and rising sea levels on a national scale. There are no effective measures to respond to other phenomena, such as ocean acidification, on a national scale. For more information, please refer to <em>Annex A2. Impacts of climate change</em>.</p>
<h3 id="overview-of-targets-measures-and-requirements">4.2 Overview of targets, measures and requirements </h3>
<p>In the context of adaptation, the GoT identified three targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% of land in Tonga utilized for agro-forestry or forestry by 2025,</li>
<li>Prevent any permanent loss of land to rising sea levels on Tonga’s four main islands (i.e. Tongatapu, Ha’apai, Vava’u, and ‘Eua),</li>
<li>Maintenance of the existing stocks of fish and other marine species.</li>

<p>These targets were derived from the 20 targets identified in the Joint National Action Plan 2 on Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management 2018-2028 (JNAP 2). However, for the purpose of the 2020 NDC, three targets have been selected as being closely related to the priorities of coping with increasing temperatures and rising sea levels. In addition, for the purpose of the 2020 NDC, the selected targets were defined more closely and formulated as quantifiable targets in order to be able to evaluate progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target of 30% of land being utilized for agro-forestry or forestry has been amended by a target year.</li>
<li>The target of preventing any permanent land loss to rising sea levels has been derived from the JNAP 2 target of resilient coastal development, infrastructures, and integrated coastal ecosystems management.</li>
<li>The target of maintaining Tonga’s stocks of fish and other marine species has been derived from the 2018 JNAP 2 target of resilient fisheries and marine and coastal ecosystems.</li>
</ul>
<p>The target of 30% of land in Tonga being utilized for agro-forestry or forestry is envisioned to be achieved by planting of one million trees by 2023, among others. Successfully planting one million trees will require technical expertise, financial support, and consent from various stakeholders in order to determine what kind of trees will be planted, the land on which the trees will be planted, and who will be responsible for planting the trees.</p>
<p>The expansion of MPAs and SMAs is regarded as an important means to achieve the two targets of preventing any permanent loss of land to rising sea levels on Tonga’s four main islands and maintaining existing stocks of fish and other marine species. In that context, the Government of Tonga aims to expand the area covered by MPAs and SMAs to 30% of Tonga’s EEZ. In order to be effective, the expansion of MPAs will require a clear definition of MPAs — including if and how they differ from SMAs — as well as strengthened enforcement.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Planning Process</strong></h2>
<h3 id="information-on-the-process-to-prepare-the-ndc">5.1 Information on the process to prepare the NDC </h3>
<p>The Tonga Strategic Development Framework 2018-2028 (TSDF II) is the overarching national planning document and the principles of the TSDF II have informed the development of the 2020 NDC. There are a number of key sectoral policies and plans which have also informed the 2020 NDC. These include the Tonga Energy Road Map, the Energy Efficiency Master Plan, the National Forestry Policy and the JNAP 2.</p>
<p>The Department of Climate Change has led the development of Tonga’s second NDC. The Department reviewed the progress made to date towards achieving the targets identified in the 2015 INDC and identified means of how to enhance the 2020 NDC. As part of this process, the Department of Climate Change took a coordinating role in gathering input from stakeholders, both for evaluating progress on the 2015 INDC and designing the 2020 NDC. The review of progress and the development of recommendations for the 2020 NDC were informed by data sets, academic studies, policies, strategies, roadmaps and other reports and structured interviews with stakeholders in Tonga, including government and non-government organisations. <em>Further details of the review and recommendations process are available in Annex 3 of this NDC in the “Review of the 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution and Recommendations for the 2020 Nationally Determined Contribution s” report.</em></p>
<p>The review and recommendations were discussed, comments were received and integrated, and the findings were validated by the Tonga JNAP technical team and relevant stakeholders through national workshops. These meetings were attended by stakeholders from government, private sector and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with approximately 25 women and 20 men taking part in the workshops. The 2020 NDC was then prepared building on the recommendations which had been developed and went through a final validation process with the JNAP technical team and national stakeholders. Once the 2020 NDC contents had been agreed across ministries and departments, the NDC was submitted to and approved by Cabinet.</p>
<h3>5.2 Information on implementation plans</h3>
<p>Tonga is currently developing a LT-LEDS which will be submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021. This NDC is aligned with the upcoming LT-LEDS and stakeholder dialogue for the development of the LT-LEDS has fed into the development of the 2020 NDC. The Tongan Government also intends to develop a NDC Roadmap and Investment Plan in 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Fairness and Ambition</strong></h2>
<p>Tonga is a SIDS and its GHG emissions are negligible on a global scale. Due to its geography and economy, Tonga is highly affected by the adverse impact of climate change. Tonga is classified as one of the most at-risk countries in the world in terms of its exposure to the unfolding effects of climate change. The ongoing need for Tonga to invest large portions of its public finance and service capacity in the ambitious quest to achieve our climate resilience objectives is a consequence of the emissions of other large countries over many generations as they developed and became wealthy. Achieving the targets set out in Tonga’s 2020 NDC will require considerable support for financing, capacity and technology investment. Accounting for these circumstances, Tonga considers its NDC as fair and ambitious.</p>

<td>(c) How the Party has taken into consideration paragraphs 31 (c) and (d) of decision 1/CP.21;</td>
<td>
<p>Tonga aimed to include all categories of anthropogenic emissions or removals in its NDC. However, targets for GHG emission reductions could only be developed for the energy sector because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Industrial processes and product use (IPPU): There is a paucity of data for the IPPU sector, preventing the inclusion of the sector. In addition, GHG emissions from IPPU represent a fraction of Tonga’s total greenhouse gas emissions given the absence of mineral, chemical, metal, electronics and other manufacturing industries as well as the limited use of lubricants, paraffin waxes and solvents. Therefore, omission of the sector has a negligible impact on Tonga’s NDC.</li>


<li>Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector: Paucity of reliable data leads to significant uncertainty in any attempt to quantify GHG emissions and carbon sequestration from forests and other woody biomass. For example, the Government of Tonga’s Third National Communication states that GHG emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) are entirely offset by carbon sequestration from the country’s forests, with changes in forest and other woody biomass capturing an estimated 1,437.5 gigagrams of CO<sub>2</sub>e and abandonment of managed lands sequestering a further 441.8 gigagrams of CO<sub>2</sub>e (Government of Tonga 2019). However, these estimates could not be confirmed based on the available land use data. Therefore, the AFOLU sector is not considered as part of Tonga’s NDC. However, Tonga is striving to include anthropogenic emissions or removals from AFOLU sector in its 2025 NDC.</li>


<li>Waste: Paucity of relevant data on waste amounts and waste composition prevented considering GHG emissions from the waste sector as part of Tonga’s NDC. However, Tonga is striving to include anthropogenic emissions from waste in its 2025 NDC.</li>

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO (2014) indicate that temperatures will increase by 1.0°C by 2030 under all emission scenarios, and between 0.2°C and 4.1°C by 2090 depending on the emission scenario. In its Third National Communication, the Government of Tonga (2019) suggests an increase in temperature of up to 0.7°C by 2030 and 2.6°C by 2090. An increase in temperatures has direct repercussions for agriculture, fishery, and human health.</p>
<p>First, impacts from rising temperatures are expected to be particularly pronounced in the agriculture sector. Agriculture is a crucial sector in Tonga, accounting for approximately 15% of the country’s GDP in 2018/19, with a quarter of the country’s employed laborers working in agriculture, forestry and fishing (Tonga Statistics Department 2019; Tonga Statistics Department 2018). Furthermore, in 2015, more than 80% of Tonga’s population were engaged in agriculture to meet their own food needs or earn cash income through sale, with squash, yam, taro, sweet potato and cassava representing the most common crops (MAFF et al. 2015). Higher temperatures can lead to lower crop yields because levels of photosynthesis decrease at temperatures above 25°C for tropical crops, like sweet potato, cassava, taro, and yams (Hay et al. 2003).</p>
<p>Second, according to Dutra et al. 2018, increase in temperature along with nutrient enrichment and ocean acidification can affect corals’ immune response, thus increasing the susceptibility of corals to diseases and affecting their survivability and growth. Higher sea surface temperatures of Tonga’s coastal waters have reportedly led to reduced fish catch as a result of widespread coral bleaching (Government of Tonga 2018b).</p>
<p>Third, Tonga, along with most Pacific island countries, faces effects of water scarcity, vector-, food- and waterborne diseases (McIver et al. 2016). Increasing temperatures are known to facilitate the spread of foodborne diseases such as diarrheal disease, ciguatera and salmonella, due to an increase in the concentration of certain pathogens in food along the pathway from preparation and handling to cooking, serving and storing (WHO 2015). In addition, an increase in temperature may exacerbate Tonga’s incidences of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity and diabetes. As one of the countries with the highest obesity and diabetes rates worldwide — affecting two in five and one in five Tongans respectively — an increase in temperature may contribute to further worsening of public health (WHO 2016). For example, temperature extremes put type-2 diabetes patients at increased risk (Hajat et al. 2017). Similarly, Moellering and Smith (2012) suggest that as air conditioning increases with the rise in temperatures, energy expenditure of the human body decreases which may contribute to rising obesity rates.</p>
<h4 id="increase-in-extreme-rainfall-events">Increase in extreme rainfall events </h4>
<p>Projections for the impact of climate change on rainfall patterns are subject to considerable uncertainty. While existing projections suggest with high confidence that extreme rain events will occur more frequently, there is low confidence that mean annual rainfall will be affected by climate change (Government of Tonga 2019; Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2014). An increase in extreme rain events can be expected to adversely impact infrastructure, agriculture, and public health in Tonga.</p>
<p>First, an increase in extreme rainfall events threatens to reduce agricultural productivity in Tonga (Government of Tonga 2018b). As a large share of Tonga’s population relies on subsistence agriculture, reduced production might threaten food security of many households. Furthermore, lower productivity as a result of an increase in extreme rainfall events will likely affect revenue from agriculture exports which are vital for the Tongan economy (Government of Tonga 2019). In 2019, agriculture products represented almost half of the country’s export revenue (National Reserve Bank of Tonga 2019).</p>
<p>Second, Tonga occasionally faces heavy rainfall that causes flooding and prolonged ponding of water, which is associated with health risks such as waterborne and vector diseases, including dengue fever (Fakhruddin 2015). In 2017, the Tongan Ministry of Health has expressed concerns with the increased risk of dengue fever due to heavy rainfall (Tonga Broadcasting Commission 2017). Moreover, in the Pacific, WHO (2015) identified diarrheal illness as the most significant category of waterborne disease caused by changes in temperature, rainfall and humidity.</p>
<p>Third, while a systematic analysis is prevented by paucity of data, extreme rainfall events are considered to cause considerable damage to infrastructure. Finally, heavy rainfall in combination with insufficient drainage systems increases surface runoff, resulting in the pollution of nearby coastal areas due to sediments and debris washing into these areas (Government of Tonga 2018b).</p>
<h4 id="occurrence-of-droughts">Occurrence of droughts </h4>
<p>Existing projections suggest little change in the incidence of droughts in Tonga due to climate change. However, confidence levels behind these projections are low since the confidence level of changes in mean rainfall change is low. Furthermore, there is no consensus about projected changes in ENSO and their impact on rainfall patterns (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2014; Government of Tonga 2019). Although droughts might not increase due to climate change, they already pose a threat, particularly to Tonga’s agriculture sector and public health. If climate change was to result in more prolonged droughts, their impact would further increase.</p>
<p>First, agricultural droughts — i.e. insufficient soil moisture to meet the needs of a crop — are already occurring regularly in Tonga (Government of Tonga 2019). Such droughts severely affect agriculture productivity in the country, resulting in stunted growth of annual crops such as squash, vegetables, yams, sweet potatoes, root crops, and coconuts (Government of Tonga 2018b; FAO and MAFF 2014).</p>
<p>Second, despite the uncertainty in the projection of droughts in Tonga, droughts already pose health threats to the country’s population. For example, prolonged dry periods have caused reduced access to potable water (Fakhruddin 2015). Historically, droughts in 1982-83 and 1997-98 resulted in water shortage, devastating agriculture harvests in those years and causing food shortages (Government of Tonga 2018a). Such threats would be exacerbated in case the frequency or intensity of droughts were to increase as a result of climate change.</p>
<h4 id="rise-in-sea-levels">Rise in sea levels </h4>
<p>Sea levels in Tongan territorial waters are predicted to rise under all emissions scenarios, though projections show considerable differences in the magnitude of that rise, with projections suggesting a 7-27cm rise by 2030 and an increase of 11-88cm by 2090 (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2014; Government of Tonga 2019). Rising sea levels have a large spectrum of potential impacts, from land loss to salinization of ground water to degradation of coral reefs and migration, among others.</p>
<p>First, along with many countries in the South Pacific, Tonga has experienced the risk of inundation and flooding as a result of sea level rise, making low-lying islands inhabitable (Mimura 1999). Additionally, short duration coastal flooding events can have devastating impacts on coastal infrastructure that further increases risks to populations residing in coastal areas (Aucan 2018). While a systematic analysis is prevented by paucity of data, more than 80% of Tonga’s population resides within a distance of less than 1km from the shore, suggesting a very high vulnerability to rising sea levels (Neil et al. 2019). Sea level rise combined with extreme weather events is likely to contribute to an increase in inundation of low-lying areas. Estimates suggest that flooding and inundation will affect approximately 4% to 14% of the total population of Tongatapu (Rawat et al. 2016). Even under a medium emissions scenario,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> considerable parts of Tongatapu are projected to be inundated by 2090. In particular, this would affect Nuku’alofa and the northern coasts of Tongatapu (Climate Central 2020). Ultimately, a considerable share of the population may have to relocate closer to the center of the islands.</p>
<p>Second, rise in sea level will cause seawater intrusion in low lying coastal areas, which can reduce the availability of freshwater as salinity of groundwater increases (Government of Tonga 2018b). Furthermore, the marginal areas of farmland on the coast are expected to experience higher moisture and increased salinization due to inundation or flooding, reducing their suitability for agriculture (Rawat et al. 2016). Land loss, in addition to saltwater intrusion, is also predicted to reduce the availability of potable water (Fakhruddin 2015).</p>
<h4 id="increase-in-ocean-acidification">Increase in ocean acidification </h4>
<p>Higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes more CO<sub>2</sub> to be absorbed by the world’s oceans. As more CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in the sea, ocean pH decreases, and aragonite saturation levels fall. This process is commonly referred to as ocean acidification. Coral reefs are highly vulnerable to projected decreases in ocean pH and aragonite saturation levels, as corals and crustaceans use aragonite to build their skeletons. At atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> above 450 ppm, aragonite levels could fall to levels that make it impossible for corals to sustain building their skeletons (Bell et al. 2011).</p>
<p>In Tonga, aragonite saturation levels are predicted to decrease to 3.5Ω by 2035 and continue to decline further (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2014, Government of Tonga 2019), threating corals’ reef-building calcification rates and structural integrity, making coral reefs the most vulnerable marine habitat in the tropical Pacific region (Fakhruddin 2015).</p>
<p>In particular, according to Dutra et al. 2018, increase in ocean acidification is expected to impact on coral physiology (calcification rates, ability to repair tissues and growth), behavior (feeding rate), reproduction (early life-stage survival, timing of spawning) as well as weaken calcified structures, and alter coral stressresponse mechanisms (Fabricius et al. 2015; Fabricius et al. 2011). In addition, ocean acidification is predicted to pose moderate to high risk to the demersal fish and intertidal invertebrates with shells made of calcium carbonate (Fakhruddin 2015). These combined impacts could potentially have detrimental consequences for fisheries (IPCC 2014; Dutra et al. 2018). With more than 13% of Tongan households engaged in fisheries for both consumption and sale, this would affect a considerable share of the population (Tonga Statistics Department 2018).</p>
<h4 id="decline-in-frequency-but-increase-in-intensity-of-cyclones">Decline in frequency but increase in intensity of cyclones </h4>
<p>While the number of cyclones is projected to decrease, their intensity in the Southeast Pacific Ocean basin in Tonga will increase (Government of Tonga 2019). The frequency is predicted to decrease varying from 6% to 35%, while the mean maximum wind speeds are predicted to increase between 2% and 11% (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2014). However, these projections are made with only moderate confidence. If climate change was to lead to an increase in the intensity of cyclones, it can be expected that the already existing negative impacts on agriculture, coral reefs and fisheries, and public health would be exacerbated.</p>
<p>First, Tonga is regularly affected by cyclones which cause considerable damage to agriculture and related infrastructure. Cyclones are accompanied by heavy winds, rainfall, and storm surges that devastate crops and trees (FAO 2010). For instance, Cyclone Gita in 2018 significantly damaged perennial tree crops, such as coconuts, bananas and breadfruit (Government of Tonga 2018b). Cyclone Harold in 2020 contributed a drop in agricultural export volumes by nearly 30%, with lower exports of taro and cassava (National Reserve Bank of Tonga. 2020). In addition, cyclones contribute to soil erosion and salinization, which lead to loss of soil nutrients in coastal areas and stream catchments, creating unfavorable conditions for crop cultivation (FAO 2010; Government of Tonga 2018b). In addition, past cyclones have caused considerable damage to infrastructure, such as transport infrastructure and buildings. In turn, some of that infrastructure is essential to support the agriculture sector, like farm buildings and fences (FAO 2010).</p>
<p>Second, cyclones – in combination with heavy rainfall – affect coral reefs, fisheries and related infrastructure (Dutra et al. 2018; FAO 2014). Once damage has been done by cyclones, fish habitats such as coral reefs take years to re-establish and function normally, thus negatively affecting ecosystems that depend on coral reefs (Government of Tonga 2019). Furthermore, cyclones destroy fishing vessels and equipment. For example, Cyclone Ian in 2014 severely devastated the fisheries sector of Ha’apai, due to damage sustained to fishing boats, outboard motors and an estimated 100% of all fishing gears (FAO 2014). If climate change was to cause an increase in the intensity of cyclones, the damage to coral reefs and fisheries would increase accordingly.</p>
<p>Third, cyclones, along with other extreme weather events, have a direct impact on health, especially from water contamination (WHO 2015). As tropical cyclones bring heavy rainfall and provoke flooding, water treatment plants tend to be overwhelmed, leading to cross-contamination between sewage and drinking water pipes, sewage overflow, or bypass into local waterways (Semenza and Nichols 2007).</p>
