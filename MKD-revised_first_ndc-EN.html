<h1> Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution </h1>
<p>Submission by the Republic of North Macedonia </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Republic of North Macedonia, a non-Annex I party to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), ratified Paris Agreement in November 2017, with the following nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the global efforts for GHG emissions reduction (initial NDC, submitted 2015): “To reduce the CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion for 30%, that is, for 36% at a higher level of ambition, by 2030 compared to the business as usual (BAU) scenario.” The focus of the initial NDC is put on climate change mitigation, and particularly to CO2 emissions from fossil fuels combustion which covers almost 80% of the total GHG emissions in the country. The following sectors are of dominant share: energy supply, buildings and transport.</p>

<p>The Republic of North Macedonia is a candidate country for European Union (EU) membership, and as a Western Balkan Contracting Parity of Energy Community, committed to work towards the 2050 climate neutrality target – the heart of the European Green Deal, like the rest of the EU in the frame of the Energy Community.</p>
<p>The first round of NDCs, if fully implemented, would lead to warming of 2.9 degrees C to 3.4 degrees C over the course of the century. Enhanced mitigation ambition is therefore essential to achieving the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit warming to well below 2 degrees C, or 1.5 degrees C. The Agreement set up a mechanism to enhance ambition for climate action over time, requiring each country to prepare and communicate NDC every five years to reflect its highest possible ambition.</p>

<h2>Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution</h2>

<p>In response of the COP decision at Paris, reiterated by 2018 decision at COP24 in Katowice, and in line with the Decision of the Government from its 65th session held on April 13th 2021, the Republic of North Macedonia communicates the following enhanced nationally determined contribution to the global efforts for GHG emissions reduction:</p>
<p><strong>In 2030, 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expressed in net<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> emissions, in 2030, 82% reduction compared to 1990 levels.</strong></p>
<p>The enhanced NDC is focused on mitigation area, with a vision to include adaptation component in the subsequent submissions, once the relevant national strategic and planning documents are prepared and adopted.</p>
<p>The main components of NDC enhancement<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>are realized in the following areas: Mitigation ambition, Implementation and Communication</p>

<p>The country counts with extensive national expertise for reporting towards the UNFCCC (GHG inventory preparation, mitigation modelling and emissions projections) sited at the Research Center for Energy and Sustainable Development of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences Arts and other academic institutions (for nonenergy sectors).</p>
<p>The enhanced NDC is based on a robust analytical work and consultations with the relevant stakeholders aimed at:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Identification and validation of possible mitigation PAMs in the target sectors in agreement with the sector policies and planning documents, as well as with the European Policy on Climate and Energy.
</li>
<li>
Identification and validation of the assumptions used for the modelling of the identified PAMs in line with the sector policies and planning documents, as well as with the European Policy on Climate and Energy.
</li>
<li>
Prioritization of identified PAMs and providing directions for development of mitigation scenarios with existing and with additional measures.
</li>

<p>In particular, the enhanced NDC is built on the understanding that for the realization of the mitigation goals, bottom-up support is needed through active participation of local governance levels. Therefore, it was informed by a number of studies conducted at local level, like <span class="underline">Heating Study of the City of Skopje</span> and <span class="underline">Transport</span> <span class="underline">Study of the City of Skopje</span>, as well as <span class="underline">Climate Change Strategy of</span> <span class="underline">the City of Skopje: Resilient Skopje</span>.</p>

<p>The Republic of North Macedonia is a small (25,713 km2) landlocked country, located in the middle of the Balkan Peninsula. It has a diverse topography with high mountains and deep valleys, large and small natural lakes and picturesque rivers. The agricultural land covers 50% of the surface area while forests cover about one third from the country. The country has a diverse climate, with eight climatic regions.</p>
<p>The enhanced NDC was prepared against a backdrop of the country being a candidate for EU membership and becoming 30th member of the NATO Alliance. The results from the past reforms including the solid macroeconomic fundamentals, job creation, and an open economy that has attracted foreign investment will help the country to capitalize on this renewed outlook. However, the weak state institutions, low and declining productivity of local firms, and deficiencies in competition and investment policy and business regulation continue to pose serious structural challenges to economic growth. A competitive business legal framework is missing, so the private sector is weak and incapable to fully exploit the country’s location. Furthermore, there are risks to fiscal sustainability and the Government has limited fiscal space to stimulate the economy properly. Educational achievement is relatively poor and unequitable which limits labor market in terms of skills to meet the evolving demands of a modern economy, as well as creates inequality in access to economic opportunities. Finally, climate and environmental threats, including air pollution, require urgent attention or they may slow economic growth and reverse poverty reduction.</p>
<p>The Voluntary National Review (VNR, 2020) related to 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reveals that there is high probability that 27 percent of the SDG indicators will be met by 2030. About 29 percent can be achieved by 2030 with significant policy efforts, whereas the remaining 44 percent seem to be unattainable with the current development mode.</p>
<p>Finally, socio-economic impact assessment indicate that COVID-19 has had a serious negative impact on the economy of the Republic of North Macedonia of a magnitude that exceeds that of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.</p>

<p>The enhanced NDC capitalized on the <strong>analytical capacities, participatory practice, experience, tools and knowledge base</strong> that have been created even before the initial NDC, and maintained and enhanced over the SBUR, Energy Strategy, TBUR, NECP and Long-term Strategy on Climate Action timelines. The target setting was well-informed by the <strong>existing robust and comprehensive GHG inventory</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <strong>enhanced NDC wove the sustainable development into its PAMs</strong>, quantifying the nexus of sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Specifically, related to economic and environmental dimensions, MAC Curve was developed to perform economic and environmental evaluation of PAMs. The social aspects of the PAMs are addressed by (i) calculation of <strong>the newly created jobs</strong>, (ii) introduction of the <strong>gender indicators</strong> in some of the PAMs with an aim to make them gender-responsive and (iii) organization of a virtual <strong>youth consultation</strong> on the enhanced NDC, designed to ensure that the voices of young people are expressed in the NDC and that there will be broad ownership for the enhanced NDC goals.</p>
<p>The benefits of <strong>Circular Economy</strong> on GHG emission reduction are analyzed with an aim to identify opportunities and challenges for the mitigation through advancing circular practices in the waste management sector, in line with the European Green Deal and the EU Action Plan on Circular Economy.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>the role of the private sector</strong> in the mitigation action, it participates with 85% in total investments needed for realization of the PAMs in the Industry sector. So far, supported by feed-in tariff mechanism, 110 private companies have invested in 140 MW RES capacities (dominantly solar and small hydro).</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>the enhanced NDC includes also a regional dimension</strong>. Its contributions to regional development are credibly demonstrated as the five priority measures from the draft Strategy for Regional Development 2019-2029 - (1) Ensuring just transition (Pelagonija and Southwest region), (2) Increasing renewable electricity production (Southeast, East and Northeast region), (3) Increasing energy efficiency in industry (Skopje, Polog and Vardar region), (4) Improving energy efficiency in households (East, Pelagonija, Vardar and Skopje region) and (5) Mitigation of climate change through landfill gas burning (in all regions where regional landfills with waste mechanical and biological treatment will be constructed) are adequately linked to the relevant PAMs from the enhanced NDC.</p>

<p>In December 2019, the country adopted a National Strategy for Energy Development up to 2040, which is the first strategy of an Energy Community Country which is based on the five pillars of the EU Energy Union - Security, solidarity and trust; A fully integrated internal energy market; Energy efficiency; Decarbonizing the economy; Research, innovation and competitiveness. Hence, the Energy Strategy depicts three scenarios - Reference, Moderate Transition and Green which reflect different dynamics of energy transition and enable flexibility into Macedonian response to relevant EU policies and governance for modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy by 2050</p>
<p>The Energy Community is rapidly advancing the implementation of EU regulations for energy governance and integrated climate and energy planning, and the country is leading an exemplary process of developing a draft National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), the first of its kind in the Energy Community.</p>

<p>How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Following the Talanoa Call for Action, launched by the Presidents of COP 23 and COP 24, the Republic of North Macedonia made its NDC (2020) more ambitious than NDC (2015) (i) articulating the target of 51% reduction in GHG emissions of 2030 compared to 1990 level, instead of 30% deviation from BAU in 2030, and (ii) maintaining the pace of the “ratchet-up mechanism”.</p>
<p>National commitments are well in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 that correspond to long term goal of the Paris Agreement. It is further important to note that the evolving nature of a country’s circumstances is to be reflected in the consideration of fairness through the following indicators:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Responsibility reflected in a country’s past and current GHG emissions.</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>

<em>County’s emissions (2016) as percentage of World emissions (2016)</em>: 0.022%</li>
<li><p><em>Country’s per capita emissions (2016) as percentage of World per capita emissions (2016)</em>: 79%</li>
<li><em>Country’s historical emissions (cumulative 1990-2016) as percentage of World emissions (cumulative 1990-2016</em>): 0.032%</li>
</ul></ul>


<ul>
<li>
<p>Ability to invest in appropriate mitigation measures (capacity to contribute to solving the climate change problem)</p>
</li>
<ul>

<li><em>GDP growth level:</em> North Macedonia lags behind the Southeast Europe (SEE) average, as well as the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). As projected by the International Monetary Fund and Ministry of Finance, until 2040 the Macedonian real GDP growth rate will grow at an average rate of 3.3%.</li>
<li><em>GDP per capita:</em> Such GDP growth rate could be expected for a developing country, and should lead to convergence towards levels of GDP per capita that are common for developed CEE countries today.</li>
</ul></ul>


<ul>
<li>
<p>The mitigation potential and costs</p>
</li>



<ul><li>
<p>The economic and environmental analyses (<em>MAC curve</em>) has estimated the total reduction in 2030 at 5.6 Tg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq (achievable if all the proposed PAMs are implemented as planned). 70% of the reduction can be achieved with negative costs (with PAMs of “win-win” type which are two thirds of all PAMs).</p></li>
</ul></ul>

<p>Furthermore, additional 20% of the reduction can be realized by PAMs with specific costs in the range 0 - 5 €/t CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. Hence, there is relatively high mitigation potential which can be harnessed with cost-effective PAMs. This makes economic case of decarbonization pathway being cheaper than current policy pathway.</p>
<p>The investments needed for realization of the decarbonization scenario are estimated at 7.7% of the total average annual GDP. As indicated in the sectoral action plans, beside domestic investments, the country would count on international support (international funds, donors, banks) which will contribute towards adjusting the development pathway of the Republic of North Macedonia towards a low-carbon economy, enhancing further the decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and ensuring a decent level of real GDP per capita. Along with the international financial support, the country will also need assistance in the form of technology transfer and capacity building.</p>

<p>Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) Curve tool was applied in order to evaluate the economic and environmental effectiveness of PAMs. As depicted in the MAC curve (Figure 1), the total reduction in 2030 amounts 5.6 Tg CO2-eq (achievable if all the proposed PAMs are implemented as planned). 70% of the reduction can be achieved with negative costs (with PAMs of “win-win” type which are two thirds of all PAMs). Furthermore, additional 20% of the reduction is realized by PAMs with specific costs in the range 0 - 5 €/t CO2-eq</p>

<p><strong>Jobs:</strong> It was shown that the enhanced NDC would bring new jobs, almost 8,000 in 2030 and 10,000 in 2035, with dominant contribution of energy efficiency PAMs of 77% (Figure 2). PAMs with the highest share in the number of new domestic green jobs are: Retrofit of existing residential buildings (42%), Construction of passive houses (21%), RES without incentives (6%) and Solar thermal collectors (8%).</p>
<p><img src="MKD-NDC1_3.png"/></p>

<p>Figure 2. Number of domestic green jobs by PAMs</p>
<p><strong>Gender:</strong> Based on the types of the newly created jobs, very basic analysis indicated that at least 27% of the jobs in 2035 can be assigned to women. Furthermore, the PAMs were analyzed in light of their gender responsiveness. It was found that there are number of PAMs where gender disaggregated approach would improve the implementation, particularly the PAMs related to subsidizing mitigation technologies and awareness rising. Subsequently, with an aim to make the enhanced NDC gender-responsive, the respective PAMs were redesigned and gender indictors included. Most prominent example is redesign of the “first come, first served” subsidy model to a gender informed model that supported 10,000 most vulnerable households in most affected cities in the country to replace their heating technology with more efficient one.</p>
<p><strong>Youth:</strong> A virtual youth consultation on the enhanced NDC was organized to ensure that the voices of young people are expressed in the NDC and that there will be broad ownership for the enhanced NDC goals. As a result, three pressure points vital to ensuring the quality and impactfulness of youth engagement in the Climate Promise have been recognized and weaved into the design of the Youth for Climate platform. They include:<ul>
<li> Establishing rapport with the use of interactive tools.</li>
<li> Broadening the conversation beyond the “climate niche” by introducing content related to social, economic and technological trends impacting the development of the country.</li>
	<li> Recognizing informality in youth-led climate action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the results of the consultations, three key action points on the strategic level have been identified and incorporated into the NDC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing a systemic, long-term approach to youth engagement in consultations and decision-making regarding national and local climate policies and actions, including new mechanisms, new roles and new tools.</li>
<li>Incorporating feedback loops into the existing system, allowing for two-way communication and monitoring of climate-related activities designed and implemented by the youth and/or public administration.</li>
<li> Revising educational and mainstreaming approaches and tools used to inform young people and broader public about the causes and consequences of climate crisis, including the topic of individual impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-role-of-the-private-sector">The role of the private sector</h3>

<p>The role of the private sector in the mitigation action is particularly analyzed through consideration of additional PAMs in the Industry sector that contribute to (i) increasing energy efficiency, (ii) increasing renewable sources utilization for electricity production and (iii) improving waste management, and hence improving the productivity of the companies and reducing their emissions (total GHG emissions by 10.6% and local emissions (SOx) by 98%.</p>

<p>Regarding investments, the private sector has a dominate role as it participates with 85% in total investments needed for realization of the PAMs in the Industry sector. So far, supported by feed-in tariff mechanism, 110 private companies have invested in 140 MW RES capacities (dominantly solar and small hydro). According to the official data from the State Statistical Office, the number of companies in the sector “Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” in 2018 doubled compared to 2017 (224 vs. 107) which is mainly a result of the companies which invested in renewables. Having in mind that more than 2,000 MW (solar, wind, small hydro, biomass and biogas) are projected by 2040, it is expected that this prominent role of the private sector will be sustained and even enhanced.</p>

<h3 id="sdgs---enhanced-ndc-synergies-and-trade-offs">SDGs - enhanced NDC synergies and trade-offs</h3>


<p>Aiming at understanding the contribution of the enhanced NDC to the national SD agenda, the SCAN tool and the newly developed Q-SCAN tool were applied to identify and quantify their synergies and trade-offs. Figure 3 depicts the aggregated synergies and trade-offs of three sectors from the enhanced NDC - Electricity &amp; heat, Transport, Buildings.</p>

<p><img src="MKD-NDC1_4.png"/></p>

<p>Figure 3. Electricity &amp; heat, Transport, Buildings sectors – Synergies and Trade-offs</p>
<p>The pattern of the integral scores follows the pattern of the sector Electricity &amp; Heat, which indicates that this sector is dominant in influencing the SDGs. The strongest synergies remain with SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth due to the new job opportunities in renewable energy deployment and in the construction and retrofit market; sustained economic growth, improved economic efficiency per unit of product and sustained support of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The most significant trade-off is with the SDG 15 Life on land, due to the land requirements from renewable energy projects, potential forest degradation and potential river routes changes. However, the highest synergies are almost three times stronger than the highest trade-offs.</p>

<h2 id="circular-economy">Circular Economy</h2>

<p>The benefits of Circular Economy on GHG emission reduction are analyzed with an aim to identify opportunities and challenges for the mitigation through advancing circular practices in the waste management sector. Six case studies were selected, as to include:</ul>

<li>Construction &amp; Demolition Waste (C&amp;D)</li>
<li>Biowaste</li>
<li> Secondary Residual Fuels (SRF)</li>
<li> E-Waste</li>
<li> End of Life Vehicles</li>
<li>Plastics</li></ul>
<p>Overall, it was assessed that applying circular practices to the selected case studies and waste streams by 2030, can deliver: 951 Gg CO2-eq/year savings, 2,740 new jobs and 47.17 million EUR of economic benefits. Therefore, the shift to circular practices, even if it is restricted to those six case studies, is enough to counterbalance the emissions from solid waste disposal (almost double savings), and the emissions from the Waste and Industrial Processes and Product Use sectors. To achieve these benefits, a shift in governance practices is required and several policy recommendations are made, starting with the proposal to create a governmental cross-cutting agenda on circular economy.</p>

<h2 id="follow-up-activities">Follow up activities</h2>
<h3 id="covid-19-related-revisions">Covid-19 related revisions</h3>

<p>The energy transition is happening with an accelerated pace - renewables are growing fastest even as fossil fuels continue to dominate and clean technologies are opening up major new opportunities for industry and investors, even if capital markets are slower to align with the climate economy. Both solar and wind power are becoming significantly more competitive. It seems that with Covid-19 the world was just handed a once in a lifetime opportunity to fundamentally alter the energy landscape. The Republic of North Macedonia is in phase of refinement of the post-pandemic economic and emissions scenarios from the Energy Strategy, integrating the changes of fuel and technologies prices, supply chain disruptions, impact on trade and share market, as well as changes at energy demand side due to the overall slowdown of economy in the assumptions of the existing models. This will affect the enhanced NDC scenarios, but notably, they are likely to be even greener.</p>

<h3 id="climate-promise-ongoingplanned-activities">“Climate promise” ongoing/planned activities</h3>


<p>The UNDP Climate promise project will not stop supporting the NDC process, as a number of activities will continue or will be undertaken after the submission of the enhanced NDC, with an aim to strengthen its implementation prospects. A note is made to the following activities that shall be completed by June 2021:</ul>
<li>Build political will and national ownership and engagement for the NDC through policy dialogues with the key national stakeholders (key ministries, local governments, CSOs, youth constituencies, academia, private sector);</li>
<li> Engage UNFCCC and Gender Focal Points, Gender Machinery and Parliamentarian Commission on Equal Opportunities to promote leadership roles for women in climate action;</li>
<li> Carry out socio-economic impacts of NDC targets/measures;</li>
<li> Develop de-risking roadmap (policy de-risking and financial de-risking). The policy roadmap will address legislation and regulation as well as human and institutional capacity. The financial de-risking will cover market development, support schemes, and financing mechanisms. This work will also highlight opportunities for private investment or public-private partnerships in NDC actions and propose specific measures to de-risk these investments;</li>
<li> Prepare strategy for financing NDC implementation. This work will articulate proposed funding sources for all NDC actions, including those where action could be best served by realigning public finance flows and/or adopting fiscal policies and measures. It will also identify investors with portfolios that align with these opportunities;</li>
<li>Explore the possibility for introduction of carbon tax in the country. This work will assess the potential for a carbon tax to finance NDC measures and will explore the associated costs and benefits. The results of the assessment will be presented to policy-makers and the media in a high-level briefing;</li>
<li>Conduct institutional capacity assessment to identify critical skills gaps for NDC implementation and development of a mid-term capacity building plan.</li>
<li> Strengthen and improve data for tracking progress of NDCs. This activity will be continuously supported within UNDP CBIT project.</li></ul>

<h3 id="adaptation">Adaptation </h3>
<p>The Republic of North Macedonia plans to develop a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) based on nexus approaches in following areas: water, food, energy, health, biodiversity, tourism, forestry, disaster risk reduction, loss and damage, built in infrastructure. The NAP will incorporate cross-sectorial and sector-specific adaptation actions and measures, along with identified adaptation investment priorities based on the review of national and sectorial development policies and plans, and the outcomes of an extensive consultation process, including stakeholders from all sectors and levels of governance, climate-related institutions and agencies, along with private sector, civil society, academia and women associations and youth NGOs representatives. In addition, the climate change adaptation component will be included within the Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy which is prepared in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Therefore, the Republic of North Macedonia could include Adaptation component in the subsequent NDC as the mentioned strategic documents would be able to inform it.</p>
