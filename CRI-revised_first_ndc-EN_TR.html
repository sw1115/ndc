<h2 id="prólogo">I. Foreword</h2>
<p>Costa Rica is committed to promoting the well-being of all people and the country's nature and recognizes that the best way to do so is by reinforcing the commitments acquired in its Nationally Determined Contribution, presented to the international community five years ago.</p>
<p>This document contains the Nationally Determined Contribution 2020, an update and improvement of the first contribution, presented in 2015. This update increases ambition and commits Costa Rica to take actions aligned with a trajectory consistent with the global goal of limiting the increase of the global average temperature at 1.5 ° C. That's an increase in ambition over the previous contribution, which was aligned with the 2 ° C target. At the same time, the actions resulting from the contributions proposed in this document increase the country's adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce its vulnerability to climate change.</p>
<p>Costa Rica accepts the visionary challenge posed by the international community in 2015, and of which we were an active part, and recognizes that the transformation required to avoid the worst consequences of climate change will be complex, but necessary and possible. It is complex because of how intertwined greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are with economic development in our contemporary societies. It is necessary because planetary conditions would be fundamentally altered if countries do not take the essential structural measures. It is possible because most of the technical solutions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change are available; the great pending is now in matters of political, social and cultural change.</p>
<p>Faced with this complex, but necessary and possible transformation, the country needs to visualize the desired future and take a leap that allows it to establish ambitious public policies aligned with science and to mobilize profound changes in values, habits, and behaviors —that is, change cultural - that is required. This contribution is, in essence, a count of the actions necessary to achieve the change we want. A change that, to be truly transformational, will have to combine the emission reductions required by science with a positive impact on the well-being of all people and communities, particularly the most vulnerable, to generate a systemic inflection point that makes these changes permanent.</p>
<p>This 2020 Nationally Determined Contribution is informed by public policy instruments created in Costa Rica after the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and its respective ratification in 2016 and is therefore influenced by the commitments made there.</p>
<p>Since submitting its first Nationally Determined Contribution, Costa Rica has developed a new legal and institutional framework for climate action. The two pillars in adaptation and mitigation, respectively, are the National Policy for Adaptation to Climate Change of Costa Rica, presented in 2018, and the National Decarbonization Plan, launched in 2019 and presented that same year before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the country's Long-Term Strategy (ELP) under the Paris Agreement. Thus, this contribution is explicitly related to the ELP.</p>
<p>In turn, this contribution addresses national development in a comprehensive manner and connects with national public policy instruments that allow it to amplify and have a greater impact on its efforts. A central instrument is the four-year National Plan for Development and Public Investment 2019-2022, which is focused on intersectoral articulation and territorialization of development. Another key input is the Costa Rica 2050 National Strategic Plan, which is under development and whose starting point is the Costa Rica Territorial Economic Strategy: towards an inclusive and decarbonized economy 2020-2050, which will be presented in early 2021.</p>
<p>This NDC 2020 is also informed by links to other national and international agendas, including but not limited to the Sustainable Development Goals, actions under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 -2030, actions under the Convention on Biological Diversity and under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, actions on black carbon and short-lived pollutants, actions in support of the just transition, solutions based on nature and respect for worldviews and the rights of Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendant communities. These contributions are identified by icons in section IV,</p>
<p>This contribution is also aligned with the vision established in the National Policy on Cultural Rights 2014-2023. Thus, this document recognizes cultural heritage, symbolic and identity values, art and creativity as factors of social cohesion, human security and inclusion , especially for Indigenous Peoples, the Afro-descendant community, youth and women, vulnerable communities. This 2020 NDC also prioritizes the generation of green jobs that provide economic opportunities for these populations while helping to reduce emissions and strengthen adaptation and resilience. This includes economic diversification based on elements of physical proximity, such as sustainable tourism or the enhancement of traditional or innovative kitchens and agri-food systems.</p>
<p>Costa Rica's contribution and its ambition is not conditioned by the availability of international climate finance, as the country is committed to climate action and recognizes that this is the only way for sustainable development and the well-being of people and communities. However, the country indicates that it has significant needs for financial support, technology transfer and capacity building to achieve its goals, particularly in the conditions of the health and economic crisis after the global pandemic caused by COVID-19.</p>
<h2 id="document-structure">Document structure</h2>
<p>This document is structured as follows. This first section works as a prologue and introduces the document.</p>
<p>The second section presents in a concrete way the general vision of the country's transformation and contains the main goals in mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>The third section details the vision of just transition and of social and climate justice in which the contribution is framed. This section states that Costa Rica recognizes that the transformation of its economy and society are urgent and cannot be postponed and reaffirms that no person can be left behind to attend to this sense of urgency.</p>
<p>The fourth section details the operational elements of the contribution, with detailed goals and actions in 13 priority thematic areas. This section frames the commitments in the logic of climate action, which integrates mitigation and adaptation measures. For this reason, this section of the contribution is not divided between one and the other. This section contains goals on oceans, on nature-based solutions, and on short-lived pollutants, among other innovative contributions, while also including goals on traditional sectors of Costa Rican climate action, such as transportation, waste, and the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>The fifth section contains the Communication on Adaptation, in accordance with the country's commitments in Article 7, paragraph 10, of the Paris Agreement. This section includes national circumstances, the effects, risks and vulnerability of the country to climate change, the priorities of the Communication and the implementation needs.</p>
<p>The sixth section contains a brief account of the process of creating this document.</p>
<p>The seventh section contains the tables that detail the information related to the Information to Facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-overview-of-the-transformation-of-the-country">II. Overview of the transformation of the country</h2>
<p>Costa Rica recognizes that it is essential to close the social and territorial gaps that afflict the country in order to achieve sustainable development, including a decarbonized, adapted and resilient economy.</p>
<p>It also recognizes that the best way to close these gaps is by taking advantage of the competitive advantages it has to continue leading the global transition towards decarbonization and resilience, and to do so in the spirit of solidarity, multilateralism and inclusiveness that has characterized its greatest historical victories.</p>
<p>Finally, it recognizes that being a deep decarbonization laboratory at the country level is also the greatest contribution that the country can make to the global effort to limit the temperature of the planet to the goals agreed upon by the international community.</p>
<p>By virtue of the foregoing, Costa Rica intends to demonstrate fair, adapted and resilient decarbonization as the way to achieve the best version of our country in terms of economic reactivation in the short term and general well-being in the medium and long term, allowing us to fully satisfy the human rights of all people within the limits of the planet and prosper in balance.</p>
<h3 id="i.-headline-goals-in-mitigation">i. Headline goals in mitigation</h3>
<p>Costa Rica commits to an absolute maximum of net emissions in 2030 of 9.11 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), including all emissions and all sectors covered by the corresponding National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This goal is consistent with the trajectory of the National Decarbonization Plan, the Long-Term Strategy presented by Costa Rica in 2019, which seeks net zero emissions in 2050 and is in turn consistent with the trajectory of 1.5 ° C.</p>
<p>Costa Rica commits to an absolute maximum budget of net emissions for the period 2021 to 2030 of 106.53 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) including all emissions and all sectors covered by the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Corresponding greenhouse.</p>
<h3 id="meta-titular-en-adaptación">ii. Headline goal in adaptation</h3>
<p>Costa Rica is committed to strengthening the country's social, economic and environmental resilience conditions to the effects of climate change, through the development of capacities and information for decision-making, the inclusion of adaptation criteria in financing and planning instruments, the adaptation of public services, productive systems and infrastructure and the implementation of nature-based solutions.</p>
<p>Based on paragraph 11 of Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, and following the indications of Decision 9 / CMA.1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Costa Rica has decided to present its Communication on Adaptation as part of this NDC. This Communication on Adaptation can be found in Section V.</p>

<h2 id="transición-justa-justicia-social">III. Just transition, social and climate justice</h2>
<p>In keeping with our democratic, free, independent, inclusive, multi-ethnic and multicultural culture and based on a tradition of inclusion and absolute respect for human rights, Costa Rica recognizes that the transformation of its economy and society is urgent and cannot be postponed and reaffirms that no one can being left behind by addressing this sense of urgency. Even the fastest processes must take into account the needs and opportunities of all people, without losing the sense of urgency that the situation demands. For this reason, a just transition and a perspective of social and climate justice are central to not widening the existing social gaps, but reducing them.</p>
<p>The opportunities are huge. If they are well managed, as the International Labor Organization points out, transitions towards environmentally and socially sustainable economies can constitute an important engine for the creation of jobs, the conservation and regeneration of our ecosystems, the improvement of the quality of employment , social justice and the eradication of poverty.</p>
<p>Given this potential, Costa Rica understands the just transition as a process of the entire economy that produces the plans, policies and investments that lead to a future in which all jobs are green and decent, net emissions are zero, poverty has been eradicated and communities are prosperous and resilient.</p>
<p>Costa Rica recognizes that the social, economic and historical conditions of some populations increase their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Among the most vulnerable groups are people with disabilities, transgender people, the elderly, women and youth and children, Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendant communities.</p>
<p>At the same time, Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendant communities safeguard knowledge and traditions based on their respective worldviews and the relationships with nature that these entail, which are invaluable, and which should be the basis of the approach to climate action with these populations.</p>
<p>Costa Rica sees the just transition, focused on social and climate justice, as the best vehicle to build a better Costa Rica, so that the country can maximize decarbonization and increase resilience while enhancing prosperity. Through the actions detailed in this NDC, the country seeks to redouble its efforts to catalyze the transformational changes necessary to maximize the creation of collective public value, incorporating the differentiated contributions that its four main areas make to the economy: the market, the state , common goods and households, and strengthening the synergies between them.</p>
<p>In addition, this NDC incorporates monitoring, analysis and foresight efforts in order to have tools to evaluate and correct the trajectory as circumstances evolve and the technological options available to continuously seek the path of greater well-being towards the fulfillment of the objectives.</p>
<p>The just transition elements are integrated in a transversal way throughout the NDC and indicated with a specific icon in section IV to make their relationship with the climate agenda visible.</p>
<p>Additionally, Costa Rica presents the following main contributions regarding the just transition:</p>
<h3 id="section">1.</h3>
<p>By 2022 Costa Rica will have made official its "National Cycle of Ambition" with which it officially establishes the bases of a continuous, iterative and inclusive process that incorporates the diverse worldviews and knowledge and based on the best available science and that makes the necessary efforts to appropriately incorporate the groups most vulnerable to climate change, for monitoring and updating their Nationally Determined Contributions and their Long-Term Strategy under the Paris Agreement. This Cycle will help update the goals of the different instruments, seeking the best strategy to maintain the trajectory of emissions towards the goal of Decarbonization of 2050 and the emissions budget defined in this NDC for the period 2021 and 2030,</p>
<p><img src="CRI-ndc1-1.png" /></p>
<h3 id="section-1">2.</h3>
<p>By 2022, Costa Rica will have carried out a diagnosis of green and blue jobs in Costa Rica, which analyzes the state of green jobs in the country, including the identification of green and blue jobs linked to the main existing and potential value chains.</p>
<p><img src="CRI-ndc1-2.png" /></p>
<h3 id="section-2">3.</h3>
<p>By 2022 Costa Rica will have established a Just Transition Governance scheme led by the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), the Ministry of Human Development and Social Inclusion (MDHS) and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MTSS) for the sectors contemplated in the NDC. This scheme will include a working commission between the two ministries to achieve a common understanding of the just transition and to coordinate joint actions, as well as permanent and ad hoc spaces for dialogue that allow the promotion of tripartite social dialogue between the government, representatives of employers and the workers, as well as a broad social dialogue that integrates women and young people from an intersectional perspective,</p>
<p><img src="CRI-ndc1-3.png" /></p>
<h3 id="section-3">Four.</h3>
<p>By 2024, Costa Rica will have developed a Just Transition Strategy for the country, accompanied by a National Green Jobs Policy and the mechanisms to monitor and evaluate them, including the development and implementation of the necessary functions in the National Metrics System. of Climate Change (SINAMECC) to estimate green employment, the evolution of the just transition and the impact of climate action on employment and vulnerable groups, as well as to anticipate and anticipate changes in occupational demand caused by it.</p>
<p><img src="CRI-ndc1-4.png" /></p>
<h2 id="principales-áreas-de-acción">IV. Main areas of action</h2>
<p>Costa Rica conceives decarbonization and resilience as means to transform its development model to one based on social inclusion, the well-being of citizens, the circular economy, the bioeconomy, the creative and cultural economy, and green growth.</p>
<p>Costa Rican climate action integrates decarbonization, adaptation and resilience in a sectoral and territorial way. The main public policies in each area of ​​action are aimed at contributing both to reducing emissions and reducing climate vulnerability.</p>
<p>The contributions that Costa Rica presents in this NDC follow this logic of comprehensive climate action and by priority thematic areas. The following are Costa Rica's contributions in 13 priority thematic areas of its society and economy.</p>
<h3 id="movilidad-y-transporte">1. Mobility and transportation</h3>
<p>Costa Rica is committed to developing a mobility system based on active mobility and a safe, efficient public transport system, powered by renewable energy and accessible to all people, including those with disabilities; with a fleet of zero-emission light vehicles and efficient cargo transport.</p>
<p>Costa Rica's contribution to transportation represents a profound transformation from a system focused on private vehicles to one focused on the well-being of people.</p>

<p>For greater detail, Costa Rica exhaustively reported its national circumstances before the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the II Biannual Update Report before the UNFCCC, presented in December 2019.</p>
<h4 id="arreglos-institucionales-y-marco-normativo">ii. Institutional arrangements and regulatory framework</h4>
<p>Costa Rica has made decisive progress in the last decade in the creation of a legal and institutional framework that allows the adequate management of adaptation to climate change in the country.</p>
<p>The foundations for progress in adaptation matters were laid in 2011 with the creation of the Climate Change Directorate as part of the Ministry of Environment and Energy (DCC MINAE), through Executive Decree No. 36437-MINAET, and with the generation of the National Climate Change Strategy 2010-2021.</p>
<p>In 2015 and 2016, the country reached important milestones with the ratification of the Paris Agreement and the first NDC of Costa Rica. The decision to include an adaptation chapter in that first NDC gave impetus for the country to accelerate its efforts in this area.</p>
<p>Due to the cross-sectoral characteristics of the adaptation issue, the country also has a body of sectoral policies and plans that incorporate important elements to boost Costa Rica's resilience to climate change. The following are some of the policies that include adaptation components: National Plan for Development and Public Investment, National Policy for Wetlands, National Policy for the Sea, National Plan for Investments in Sanitation, National Policy for Wastewater Sanitation, National Policy and Plan of Territorial Planning, National Policy for Housing and Human Settlements, Strategy and Plan of Action for the adaptation of the biodiversity sector of Costa Rica to climate change, National Biodiversity Strategy, National Decarbonization Plan, National Policy and Plan for Disaster Risk Management, Rural Territorial Development Policy, Strategy for Low Carbon Livestock, Strategy and REDD + Action Plan, Agricultural, Fisheries and Rural Sector Plan; and National Policy of Protection Areas for Quebradas, Streams and Springs; among other.</p>
<p>However, the greatest advance in terms of public policy on adaptation that the country reports at the time of submitting this document is the officialization of the National Policy for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNACC), in 2018. This policy is based on six key axes to drive adaptation. Three of these are instrumental:</p>
<p>(a) knowledge, climate services and capacity development; (b) planning for adaptation, and (c) investment and financial security. The other three are substantives: (a) ecosystem services for adaptation, (b) adapted public services and resilient infrastructure, and (c) resilient and eco-competitive production systems. Each of these axes has a series of guidelines that detail the necessary issues to be addressed to ensure adaptation to climate change. This NDC is aligned with the PNACC and its guidelines.</p>

<p>The country also has a series of instances that are an important part of climate change governance, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Interministerial Technical Committee on Climate Change (CTICC), created by Executive Decree 36823-MINAET, of 2011, and which acts as “an advisory and support body to MINAE for monitoring the National Climate Change Strategy, it has a permanent nature, and its headquarters are the Climate Change Directorate ”(Regulation for the Creation and Operation of the Interministerial Technical Committee on Climate Change, 2011)</p></li>
<li><p>The Scientific Council on Climate Change (4C), created by Executive Decree 40615-MINAE, of 2017, as “body to advise the Government on scientific research and technological development in climate change” (Creation of the Scientific Council on Climate Change, 2017)</p></li>
<li><p>Executive 40616-MINAE, of 2017, as a “platform for citizen participation to collaborate with the implementation of the Contribution Determined at the National Level” (Creation of the Citizen Consultative Council on Climate Change, 2017)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the country has the National System for Risk Management which, under the leadership of the National Emergency Commission (CNE), operates as a multi-institutional body at all levels of the State. The Municipal Committees and Local Committees for Risk Management, as well as the Committee of Technical Advisors of the CNE are the bodies that make up the system. There is also the National Forum on Risk Management. The international framework within which the country's disaster risk management work is framed is the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.</p>
<h2 id="efectos-riesgos-y-vulnerabilidad-del-país-ante-el-cambio-climático">2. Effects, risks and vulnerability of the country to climate change</h2>
<h4 id="temperatura-y-precipitación">Temperature and precipitation</h4>
<p>There has been an increase in temperature in Costa Rica since 1960, consistent with what is happening on the planet. Between 1960 and 2017, there was an increase of 0.2 ° C compared to the base period between 1900 and 1959. The distributions by month have also undergone modifications, as can be seen in Figure 2 (in the Annex), where It is observed that the months of January, February, March, April and December are the months that have suffered the greatest variations (PEN, 2020).</p>
<p>On the other hand, changes in rainfall have also been detected. Starting in 1960, a general trend towards a decrease in the monthly average of precipitation in the country has been observed. In the months that are considered dry, that is, between November and April, the trend is curiously towards an increase in the average monthly rainfall (see Figure 3 in the Annex). However, for the rainy months, between May and October, it is where there is a marked decrease (PEN, 2020).</p>
<h4 id="eventos-hidrometeorológicos-extremos-ehe">Extreme Hydrometeorological Events (EHE)</h4>
<p>The risks that the country will face due to climate change are intrinsically linked to extreme hydrometeorological events (EHE). Although not all EHE are attributable to climate change, the trend is towards an increase in their frequency and intensity due to climate change. In recent decades there has been a marked increase in this type of event, and where existing social vulnerabilities increase the chances of disaster risk (Retana, 2012).</p>
<p>The five extreme meteorological phenomena (EMF) that cause the most frequent EHE in the country are eastern or tropical waves, depressions, cold fronts, the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and troughs. Of these, the tropical wave is the one with the highest frequency. In the same way, the EHE that register the highest frequency are: heavy rains, storm, convective storm and hail. Of these, heavy rains are the most recurrent event (81%), followed by storms, convective storms, and hail. (Morales, 2020).</p>
<p>Droughts are highly relevant for adaptation planning in the country. In Costa Rica, these events are mainly linked to the ENSO phenomenon (CHHR, 2008), although other phenomena related to the Atlantic Ocean that cause droughts have been detected (Navarro, 2019). These events mainly affect the Caribbean Region and the North Zone of the country. The losses generated by droughts are substantial. In the case of the Chorotega region, almost all the cantons have registered economic losses of ¢ 450 to ¢ 6,253 million from 1988 to 2018 (Borge et al., 2020).</p>
<h4 id="mortalidad">Mortality and affectations due to EHE</h4>
<p>EHEs cause floods, landslides, strong winds and heads of water, which translate into loss of human life. Between 1980 and 2017, 546 deaths associated with EHE were recorded. Of these, 48% were men, 26.2% women, and 25.8% were not identified. The effects of hurricanes are the ones that have claimed the most lives in the country. The National Meteorological Institute (IMN) has verified that there is a relationship between the number of deaths and the months in which EHE are most likely to occur, with October being the month with the highest number of deaths. Regarding the provinces, Puntarenas, San José and Limón are the provinces that register the most historical deaths (Carvajal, 2020).</p>
<p>1.3 million people affected (counting victims, evacuees and people who suffered indirect effects of a disaster) have been counted by EHE from 1980 to 2017, with July and October being the months that most affected. Puntarenas is, by far, the province with the greatest damage, with 964,797, with the cantons of Osa and Corredores being the most affected, with 596,851 and 339,419 respectively. The cantons of Siquirres de Limón and Turrialba de Cartago follow them, with 48,097 and 26,557 affectations respectively (Jiménez, 2020).</p>
<p>Regarding housing effects, the cantons of Golfito, Osa, Parrita, Puntarenas, Upala, Santa Cruz and Alajuela are the most affected by hydrometeorological events. On the other hand, the agricultural sector is one of the sectors hardest hit by EHE. According to the State of the Nation 2020, “in the period 1988-2019 there were 5,994 damages in the agricultural sector, generated by natural phenomena. 98.8% was caused by hydrometeorological events ”. In addition, there is a clear trend of increasing effects caused by climatic phenomena to the agricultural sector in the last 30 years. While in the decade from 1988 to 1997 the events lasted on average 4.4 days, from 2008 to 2019 that figure reached 8.9 days (PEN, 2020).</p>
<h4 id="costos-de-reparación-y-reconstrucción-por-ehe">EHE repair and rebuild costs</h4>
<p>EHEs also exert worrying pressure on public finances. The Comptroller General of the Republic determined that the costs of repair and reconstruction of infrastructure affected by EHE, be it floods, storms or droughts, went from ¢ 8,903 million in 1988 to ¢ 202,681 million in 2010. This last figure is equivalent to 1.01% of the GDP of that year. The effects occur on roads, bridges, aqueducts and other relevant infrastructure. In addition, the cost of repair for EHE is clearly increasing (see Figure 4, in Annexes), being each quarter 3% more expensive than the previous one.</p>
<p>The projections of costs for EHE in the future are not encouraging either. The Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic estimates that, if the current trend of events such as floods, storms or droughts continues, costs will continue to increase. Two scenarios were created, one conservative and one alternative. In the conservative scenario, the costs will range between 0.68% and 1.05% of GDP. In the alternative scenario, meanwhile, the costs would be between 1.64% and 2.5% of GDP. This last scenario includes the variability of the phenomenon studied, and therefore is considered more complete.</p>
<h4 id="escenarios">Climate change scenarios</h4>
<p>Costa Rica has regionalized climate scenarios taking into account the radiative forcing recommended by the IPCC: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5.</p>
<p>The IMN carried out the first regionalized climate change scenarios in 2012, and in 2017 updated these using the regional PRECIS model. The meteorological variables considered were precipitation, temperature (minimum, average and maximum), relative humidity, solar radiation (irradiance) and wind speed. In 2020, a new exercise was performed using regional models from the CORDEX experiment, as well as two statistical models: analogs and regression. The results of the latter can be accessed through the Central American Climate Change Scenario Viewer: <strong>https://centroamerica.aemet.es.</strong></p>
<p>The time horizons for these projections are: 2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2099.</p>
<p>One of the parameters that best reflects global warming in Costa Rica is the increase in the number of warm nights, defined as the number of days a year whose minimum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile of the 1971-2000 climate reference period. In the CORDEX model, with the low emissions scenario (RCP 2.6) the number of warm nights doubles towards the end of the century, or triples for the same period with the high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5).</p>
<p>In the results of the regional PRECIS model, the temperature changes (future scenario minus the control climate) of the three time horizons in all cases show an increase in temperature of the order of 1 ° C to 2 ° C. In the precipitation scenarios, in comparison with the current climate, an increase in rainfall in the North Caribbean and the North Zone is observed in the short term; and the same behavior occurs in the Nicoya Peninsula, lower parts of the Central Pacific and the southernmost sector of the South Pacific. In the rest of the regions, on the contrary, a decrease in rainfall is observed. Some figures are included in the Annex (figures 6, 7, 8 and 9) showing the results of annual rainfall projections and comparative mean annual temperature for the short and medium term.</p>

<h2 id="necesidades-de-implementación-y">4. Implementation and support needs</h2>
<h3 id="como-parte-de">As part of your commitment</h3>
<p>In order to increase resilience to climate change, Costa Rica has already mobilized national resources for the implementation of adaptation actions. However, the processes and actions necessary to increase resilience involve expenses that exceed local resources and capacities, especially if it is taken into account that Costa Rica is located in a geographical area that will be strongly impacted by climate change. Therefore, the country considers that it will require international resources at the financial, technological and capacity-building levels.</p>
<p>Costa Rica is currently developing instruments that will facilitate the identification of these more specific implementation and support needs, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Estimation of implementation costs of adaptation priorities reflected in planning instruments as well as a strategy to mobilize financial resources for their implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Disaster Risk Management Plan 2021-2025.</p></li>
<li><p>Action Plan of the National Adaptation Policy 2018-2030 (National Adaptation Plan).</p></li>
<li><p>Adaptation action plans for the six socioeconomic regions of the country.</p></li>
<li><p>Maps of current and future climate risk for all the country's cantons, as well as training to facilitate their use in the identification of priority adaptation measures in each canton.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once these processes are completed, in 2022, Costa Rica will have more concrete information on the needs and costs of implementing priority actions to meet the country's adaptation goals.</p>

<p>The updating process of the Nationally Determined Contribution of Costa Rica (NDC 2020) has been carried out combining quantitative elements of climate action models and qualitative elements developed through a planning process based on future explorative scenarios.</p>
<p>The quantitative elements cited in this NDC 2020 were developed based on the climate action models developed mainly by academic staff of the University of Costa Rica, under the leadership of the technical team of the Climate Change Directorate (DCC) and with the contribution of numerous national and international individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>The decarbonization trajectories of Costa Rica are the same ones used for the elaboration of the cost benefit analysis of the National Decarbonization Plan 2019-2050, which can be downloaded at this link: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0002867"><strong>http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0002867.</strong></a></p>
<p>For more information on this topic, it is suggested to review the ICTU tables, section VII of this document.</p>
<p>In the case of the Communication on Adaptation, an analysis of the country's public policies and a consultation with sector experts were also developed to generate the inputs that were used in the sessions of the future scenarios.</p>
<p>The planning sessions based on explorative future scenarios allowed exploring future uncertainties that could impact the future landscape of Costa Rica by 2050 and influence the possibility of reaching the climate goals.</p>
<p>In this process, key actors from the sectors included in the NDC created a series of socio-economic and environmental narrative scenarios based on contextual factors of change and described the possible implications of these changes for their sectors. Subsequently, they tested the feasibility of the current climate policies of these sectors in future scenarios, and gave recommendations to increase their robustness. The videos of the sessions, the statistics on participation and other supporting materials can be found on the DCC website (https://cambioclimatico.go.cr/actualizacion-de-la-ndc/).</p>
<p>The technical staff of the Climate Change Directorate prepared a first draft</p>
<p>Nationally Determined Contribution of Costa Rica 2020 94 for consultation based on the inputs of the modeling process and the process of future exploratory scenarios. The Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE) submitted said draft for the knowledge and consultation of the institutions and the general public on Friday, November 27 at 6:00 p.m. The document was available for consultation until Friday, December 11, 2020, at 6:00 p.m. Costa Rica time on the DCC website.</p>
<p>To strengthen this public consultation process, the Climate Change Directorate organized in November and December 2020 a series of conversations with communities and groups vulnerable to the climate crisis and who are less represented in decision-making spaces. These conversations were intended to publicize the NDC 2020 for feedback and comments. The DCC organized conversations with the Afro-descendant community, organized groups of women, youth, the transgender community, Indigenous Peoples, people with disabilities, and older adults.</p>
<p>In total, the consultation process yielded more than 165 comments, which the team from the Ministry of Environment and Energy processed between December 11 and December 18. The record of those comments can be found on the DCC website.</p>
<p>The Governing Council approved the main goals and the consultation version of this NDC 2020 in its session on December 8, 2020. A first version of this NDC 2020, which contained only the main mitigation and adaptation goals, was presented to the Executive Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on December 12 while the bulk of the comments were processed.</p>
<p>This document is the result of the incorporation into the draft consultation of the improvements collected through the public consultation process, of the inputs provided by the Ministers during and after the Governing Council and of the comments received during the conversations with the communities.</p>
<p><strong>This version of the NDC was presented on December 28, 2020.</strong></p>

<p>Alignment with the long-term vision:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The goal of this NDC for 2030 is consistent with the trajectory of the National Decarbonization Plan, the Long-Term Strategy presented by Costa Rica in 2019 and that seeks net zero emissions in 2050 and is consistent with the trajectory of 1.5 ° C.</p></li>
<li><p>Costa Rica proposes in the NDC the development of a formal process to support the update of the country's NDC every 5 years, the Cycle of Ambition. This will help update the NDC goals, seeking the best strategy to maintain the emissions trajectory towards the 2050 Decarbonization goal and the emissions budget defined in this NDC for the 2021 and 2030 period, also including considerations of the welfare of people and ecosystems.</p></li>

<p><strong>5. Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic GHG emissions and, as appropriate, removals:</strong></p>
<p>to. Assumptions and methodological approaches used to account for anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals corresponding to the Party's NDC, in accordance with decision 1 / CP.21 paragraph 31 and the accounting guidance adopted by the CMA.</p>
<p>Costa Rica accounts for emissions using the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases, which is calculated based on the IPCC methodologies for 2006 Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the guides of good practices on uncertainty and management of national inventories of greenhouse gases and the 2013 supplement to the 2006 guidelines.</p>
<p>For accounting, the global warming potentials from the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC (1995) are considered.</p>
<p>The methodological detail and the key assumptions used to estimate emissions are recorded in the National Report of the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases. The latest published can be consulted at the following link: https://unfccc.int/documents/210397.</p>
<p>b. Assumptions and methodological approaches used to account for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the NDC.</p>
<p>The detail of the methodological approach that will be used to account for the implementation of the NDC policies and measures will be included in the first BTR along with the progress report on the implementation of the NDC.</p>
<p>c. If applicable, information on how the Party will consider existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4 paragraph 14 of the PA, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Costa Rica estimates the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases based on the IPCC methodologies for National Inventories of Greenhouse Gases of 2006, the good practice guides on uncertainty and management of national inventories of greenhouse gases and the supplement of the 2013 to the 2006 guides.</p>
<p>d. IPCC methodologies and metrics used to estimate anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals.</p>
<p>Costa Rica's emissions are estimated based on the 2006 IPCC methodologies.</p>
<p>and. Assumed sector, category or activity specific methodologies and approaches, consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, including,</p>
<p>i) Approach to address emissions and subsequent removals of natural disturbances on managed lands.</p>
<p>ii) Approach used to take into account emissions and removals of harvested wood products.</p>
<p>iii) Approach used to address the effects of age class structure in forests.</p>
<p>The methodological detail and the key assumptions used to estimate emissions are recorded in the National Report of the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases. The latest published can be consulted at the following link: https://unfccc.int/documents/210397</p>
<p>Some considerations on the methodological approach as requested:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Approach to addressing natural disturbances in managed lands: Costa Rica assumes that primary forests are not managed and, consequently, emissions and removals are not estimated for primary forests except when they are deforested, assumption aligned with the 2006 IPCC guidelines Areas subject to natural disturbances were not considered relevant for anthropogenic deforestation and were also excluded. Areas subject to natural disturbances, such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, floods, and changes in river courses, and areas covered by clouds and shadows in remote sensing images were excluded.</p></li>
<li><p>Approach used to take into account the emissions and removals of harvested wood products: For the evaluation of wood products: Chapter 12 of volume 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories on Harvested Wood Products was considered. Some methodological decisions were based on the 2013 Guidelines for Good Practices and Complementary Methods arising from the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC, 2014). According to the production method that was selected for the calculation, it is considered that the Harvested Wood Products deposit is related to the forest activities and, therefore, does not imply the instantaneous oxidation of the wood in the year of harvest.</p></li>
<li><p>Class structure effects approach: Emissions from deforestation are calculated separately for primary forest and secondary forest. A different carbon pool is estimated per area for each forest type, as well as for different age classes for secondary forests. The enhancement of forest carbon stocks includes net changes in carbon stocks in the secondary forest category. This category consists of secondary forest existing in 1986 and new forest expansion since 1986. New forests are only included after they are visible through the use of satellite imagery, and this occurs when trees in new forest areas are four years old, or for some types of forests, eight years. Forest plantations are mapped as secondary forests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>F. Other assumptions and methodological approaches used to understand the NDC and, if applicable, estimate the corresponding emissions and removals, including:</p>
<p>i) How benchmarks, baselines and / or benchmarks are constructed, including, where applicable, industry, category or activity specific benchmarks, including, for example, key parameters, assumptions , definitions, methodologies, data sources and models used.</p>

<p>On climate matters, Costa Rica maintains the position that decisions should be based on the best available science.</p>
<p>At a global level, this implies accepting the scientific consensus that we must limit the increase in the planet's average temperature to 1.5 ° C to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. At the local level, it involves prioritizing climate actions over how efficient they are in reducing emissions and improving human well-being.</p>
<p>To do this, Costa Rica has worked for several years and with the support of many local and international people and organizations to develop the tools and capacities necessary to carry out this type of analysis.</p>
<p>The following figure shows a summary of the evolution of climate action modeling capacities in Costa Rica; More information about this is available at: https://cambioclimatico.go.cr/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Modelacion-para-la-Descarbonizacion-C osta-Rica.pdf.</p>

<p>The Integrated Decarbonization Trajectories Model of Costa Rica (CR-DPIM) integrates the different climate action models of Costa Rica and is the most complete set of modeling that the country has. The CR-DPIM uses internally consistent projections of national economic activity, developed with the General Equilibrium Model of the Costa Rican economy — Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling Platform (IEEM) - provided by the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR), to project the level of activity in the different sectors of the economy and then perform a multivariable linear optimization with perfect forecasting using the models of sectors and sub-sectors that make up the CR-DPIM to estimate the costs and benefits associated with meeting those demands within of the resource and emission limits established. Due to the complexity of the system, it was necessary to develop a tool to explore its assumptions, which is available at the following address:</p>
<p>https: / <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA633-1/visualization.html">/www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA633-1/visualization.html</a> . The decarbonization trajectories of Costa Rica are the same used for the elaboration of the cost-benefit analysis of the National Decarbonization Plan 2019-2050 that can be downloaded at this link: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0002867">http://dx.doi.org/10.18235/0002867.</a></p>
<p>Specifically, the goal for the year 2030 refers to the magnitude of net national emissions in the year 2030 according to the “base” trajectory (highlighted in dark green in the following figure) of decarbonization modeling. The budget for the period refers to the sum of the annual figures of net national emissions for each year from 2021 to 2030 according to the most generous modeling trajectory with emissions of 9.11 million tons of CO2e in 2030 (highlighted in red in the following figure). It should be noted that meeting the goal for the period does not necessarily guarantee meeting the goal for the year, and vice versa, so it will be important to monitor compliance with both elements throughout the NDC period.</p>

<p>g. The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, if applicable.</p>
<p>Costa Rica intends to achieve the mitigation targets of this NDC, as well as the goal of being a net zero emissions country by 2050 through domestic efforts to reduce gross emissions of greenhouse gases and maximize the potential for sequestration of greenhouse gases. natural sinks. The country will continue to participate in different forms of voluntary international cooperation, including under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, as a complement to its domestic efforts to adapt and resilient decarbonization.</p>
<p>Costa Rica will apply the "San José Principles for High Ambition and Integrity in International Carbon Markets" in all transactions and schemes associated with the GHG emissions markets in which it participates and in 2021 it will initiate formal conversations with its partners in this sense.</p>
<p><strong>6. How the Party considers its NDC to be fair and ambitious in light of its national circumstances:</strong></p>
<p>to. How the Party considers its NDC to be fair and ambitious in light of its national circumstances.</p>
<p>With this contribution, Costa Rica increased its ambition with respect to the first contribution presented by Costa Rica to the UNFCCC in 2015. The main aspects that demonstrate this are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The mitigation goals are aligned with the trajectory of Costa Rica's Long-Term Strategy, the National Decarbonization Plan, presented by Costa Rica in 2019 and which seeks net zero emissions in 2050 and is consistent with the 1.5 ° C trajectory.</p></li>
<li><p>The country went from having a maximum net absolute emissions goal by 2030 of 9.37 to 9.11 million tons of CO2e. So Costa Rica is committed to reducing an additional 0.26 million tons of CO2e by 2030.</p></li>
<li><p>Costa Rica included for the first time a goal with a maximum budget for net emissions for the period 2021-2030. This goal seeks to be consistent with the best available science and with what is required to achieve the provisions of the Paris Agreement (Article 2.1).</p></li>
<li><p>The NDC includes a section on social justice, climate and just transition. Costa Rica sees the transformation process that decarbonization implies as the best vehicle to build a better Costa Rica, so that the country can maximize decarbonization, increase resilience, and also improve the well-being of people and ecosystems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>b. Justice considerations, including a reflection on fairness.</p>
<p>Costa Rica includes in its NDC a section on just transition, social and climate justice, recognizing that the transformation of its economy and society is urgent and cannot be postponed and reaffirms that no one can be left behind by addressing this sense of urgency. Even the fastest processes must take into account the needs and opportunities of all people. For this reason, a just transition and a perspective of social and climate justice are central to not widening the existing social gaps, but reducing them.</p>
<p>The opportunities are huge. If well managed, as the International Labor Organization <a href="file:///C:/Users/mengpin.ge/World%20Resources%20Institute/Climate%20Watch%20-%20Documents/3.%20%F0%9F%93%B0%20Data%20Updates/NDC%20Data/HTML/2020%2012%2029%20Costa%20Rica/CRI.html#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnoteRef"><sup>1 points out</sup></a> , transitions towards environmentally and socially sustainable economies can be an important driver for the creation of jobs, the conservation and regeneration of our ecosystems, the improvement of the quality of the employment, social justice and the eradication of poverty.</p>
<p>Given this potential, Costa Rica understands the just transition as a process of the entire economy that produces the plans, policies and investments that lead to a future in which all jobs are green and decent, net emissions are zero, poverty has been eradicated and communities are prosperous and resilient. <a href="file:///C:/Users/mengpin.ge/World%20Resources%20Institute/Climate%20Watch%20-%20Documents/3.%20%F0%9F%93%B0%20Data%20Updates/NDC%20Data/HTML/2020%2012%2029%20Costa%20Rica/CRI.html#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnoteRef"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, Costa Rica recognizes that the social, economic and historical conditions of some populations increase vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Among the most vulnerable groups are people with disabilities, the elderly, transgender people, indigenous peoples, Afro communities, and women.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is recognized that Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendant communities safeguard a knowledge and traditions based on their respective worldviews and the relationships with nature that these entail that are invaluable, and that they should be the basis of the approach to climate action with these populations.</p>
<p>c. How the Party has addressed Article 4 paragraph 3 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>This contribution represents a progression with respect to the first one presented by Costa Rica in 2015. The main aspects that show it are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The ambition of the mitigation goal was increased, reducing the maximum committed emissions to be emitted in 2030 and committing to a new goal associated with a maximum emissions budget for the period 2021 to 2030, as described in section 6.a .</p></li>
<li><p>The goals on adaptation to climate change were strengthened. This was achieved by conducting an exhaustive mapping of adaptation actions already incorporated into existing policies, plans, programs or initiatives, including the 2018-2030 National Adaptation Policy. Using this mapping as a starting point, the process of participatory creation of future exploratory scenarios was used to analyze and strengthen these actions, as well as to add additional actions that are not currently reflected in policy instruments or initiatives in implementation, but that had been implemented. identified as essential to raise climate ambition and ensure the country's resilience to climate change.</p></li>
<li><p>An integrated approach is proposed between the mitigation and adaptation goals, this in order to take advantage of the synergies and their potential impact.</p></li>
<li><p>Climate goals are integrated into the country's development instruments, for example the National Adaptation Policy, the National Decarbonization Plan, the Decarbonization Plan, among others.</p></li>
<li><p>Social, climate justice and just transition are incorporated as a central aspect of the transition sought with the NDC and the country's long-term strategy, including specific commitments in these dimensions as well as their incorporation throughout the NDC.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recognized that the social, economic and historical conditions of some populations increase their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Among the most vulnerable groups are people with disabilities, transgender people, the elderly, women and youth and children, Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendant communities, and specific efforts are made to integrate them in appropriate ways in the design of climate action instruments and the NDC in particular.</p></li>
<li><p>At the same time, it is recognized that Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendant communities safeguard a knowledge and traditions based on their respective worldviews and the relationships with nature that these entail that are invaluable, and that they should be the basis of the approach to climate action with these populations.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of quantitative models with a robust decision-making approach under deep uncertainty is incorporated for the analysis of decarbonization routes and for the establishment of mitigation goals.</p></li>
<li><p>More detail is included on the plans and policies envisaged for the implementation of the goals described in the NDC.</p></li>
<li><p>The transparency of the NDC is improved, incorporating the present ICTU tables to improve their clarity, transparency and understanding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>d. How the Party has addressed Article 4 paragraph 4 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The contribution presented by the country is transversal to the economy, with a goal of net absolute emissions for the year 2030 and a goal of net emissions for the period 2021 to 2030.</p>
<p>and. How the Party has addressed Article 4 paragraph 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>It does not apply to the contribution from Costa Rica.</p>
