<h1>Update of the Nationally Determined Contribution of Iceland</h1>
<p>Communicated to the UNFCCC on February 18, 2021</p>
<p>This submission consists of four parts: 1) the Introduction, 2) Iceland’s updated and enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 3) Annex I, with the information provided to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of the NDC and 4) Annex II, with additional information to clarify Iceland’s climate profile, policies and legal arrangements, including information on the government pledge for Iceland to become carbon neutral by 2040.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>

<p>With this submission, Iceland updates its NDC by enhancing its commitment to at least 55 per cent net greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990, to be achieved by acting jointly with the European Union and its Member States and Norway.</p>
<p>Iceland submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2015, which became its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) upon Iceland’s ratification of the Paris Agreement, on 24 September 2016. There, Iceland announced its intention of being part of a collective delivery by European countries to reach a target of 40 per cent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.</p>
<p>In October 2019, an agreement was finalized on climate cooperation between Iceland, Norway and the EU, with the Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 269/2019, which amended Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Iceland intends to fulfil its enhanced NDC of at least 55 per cent net greenhouse gas emissions within the framework of the agreement which is subject to revision in light of the enhanced target. Iceland, along with Norway, will work with the European Union and its Member States in reviewing the relevant provisions of their 2019 agreement, as needed, on climate cooperation to reflect the enhanced emissions target for 2030.</p>
<p>Based on the EEA Joint Committee Decision No 269/2019, Iceland takes part in three key climate mitigation legislative frameworks: Emissions Trading System (ETS), which inter alia includes emissions from the heavy industry and aviation sectors in Iceland; Effort Sharing Regulation, which sets binding targets for non-ETS emissions for individual targets; and LULUCF, which covers emissions and carbon removals from the Land Use, Land Use Change</p>
<p>and Forestry sector. This means that Iceland’s contribution towards the joint fulfilment target is comparable in effort and governed by the same set of rules as for the Member States of the European Union and for Norway.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Iceland announced on 12 December 2020</span> at the Climate Ambition Summit that Iceland would increase its level of ambition from the currently pledged 40 per cent emissions cuts to 2030, to 55 per cent or more, acting jointly to achieve this enhanced target with other European States. The European Union and its Member States have since communicated that they, acting jointly, are committed to a binding target of a net domestic emission reduction of at least 55 per cent to 2030 compared to 1990. Iceland’s enhanced ambition target of 55 per cent net emissions reduction refers to the joint target of the countries involved; the individual share and commitments of each country is then determined by commonly agreed rules.</p>

<h2>Iceland‘s Nationally Determined Contribution</h2>
<p>Iceland is committed to a target of 55 per cent net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, acting jointly with the European Union and its Member States and Norway to achieve this target, within the framework of their climate cooperation agreement.</p>

<h2 id="annex-ii">Annex II </h2>

<h3>Additional information on climate change mitigation and adaptation in Iceland</h3>
<p>Iceland’s anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to almost 4.9 million tons in 2018, without LULUCF. The main sources of emissions are: Industrial processes (42%), burning of fossil fuels, mostly in road transport and fisheries (37%), agriculture (13%) and waste management (6%). Stationary energy – electricity production and heating – is produced almost 100% from renewable resources, hydro and geothermal. Some emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> in geothermal steam are attributed to geothermal energy production (3% of total emissions), while such emissions are much smaller than from energy production from fossil fuels.</p>
<h3>LULUCF</h3>
<p>The general impacts of land use activities are well understood, and LULUCF is a priority in Iceland´s Climate Action Plan. The government supports sustainable land use practices, and nature-based solutions such as restoration of woodlands, wetlands and other native ecosystems in addition to afforestation and revegetation practices. Also, the government discourages further wetlands draining and unsustainable land use practices. Iceland provides only partial information in LULUCF accounting to the Convention, as sufficient knowledge on carbon budgets for all land types is not available. Efforts are under way to improve LULUCF accounting and strengthen its scientific underpinnings, to ensure that Iceland fulfils the requirements of the EU LULUCF Regulation No 2018/841.</p>
<p>There are significant reported and estimated emissions in the LULUCF sector, mostly legacy emissions from wetlands drained in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. These emissions can be reduced or halted by reclamation of drained wetlands. Iceland also has great potential for carbon uptake by reforestation, revegetation and afforestation; actions that actively reverse historical soil erosion and loss of woodlands. As for LULUCF activities, Iceland has developed good accounting for afforestation and other activities related to forests, as well as revegetation, but less robust accounting for wetlands draining and reclamation and other activities.</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>Iceland’s main instrument for climate mitigation is the Climate Action Plan. The present plan was presented in 2018, and thoroughly <span class="underline">revised in 2020</span>. The plan outlines 48 actions across all relevant sectors intended to help Iceland meet its Paris Agreement targets for 2030 and reach the government’s aim to make Iceland carbon neutral before 2040.</p>
<h3>Adaptation</h3>
<p>Iceland has prioritized mitigation, in order to limit net greenhouse gas emissions to reach the Paris Agreement’s target of holding the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. However, adaptation measures will also be needed, in order to tackle the unavoidable impacts that will accompany higher temperatures and associated changes. Impacts of climate change on Iceland include receding glaciers, expanding woodlands, changes in sea level (higher levels in some parts, but lower in other), warming seas with changes in species distributions, and increased risks of many types of natural disasters. Of particular concern is ocean acidification and its possible impact on marine life and fisheries. Work is currently under way for a national adaptation strategy due to be finalized in 2021.</p>
<h3>Carbon Neutrality in 2040</h3>
<p>The goal of carbon neutrality is to be reached by cutting emissions in all sectors, and by increasing carbon removals from the atmosphere, including by restoration, revegetation, afforestation, and carbon capture and mineralization in rock formations <span class="underline">(Carbfix</span>). Efforts are currently under way in all these categories, which need to be strengthened for Iceland to reach carbon neutrality in 2040 and a state of negative net emissions after that. Robust carbon accounting methods are also available for these activities, which will help Iceland keeping track of progress towards the goal. Carbon accounting and reporting in the LULUCF sector in general needs to be improved, as is discussed above.</p>
<p>A new project outlining pathways towards carbon neutrality is currently being launched and will include consultations with stakeholders and the public. It can be guided by currently available accounting methods for carbon removals, but it is foreseen that the accounting framework for the carbon neutrality goal will be revised in a few years' time, when a more robust LULUCF accounting framework will be in place in Iceland.</p>
<p>Iceland is currently working on its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy, in accordance with Art. 4, Para.19, of the Paris Agreement. The project on pathways towards carbon neutrality is seen as providing needed information for the strategy, which is planned to be submitted this year.</p>
