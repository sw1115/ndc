<h1 id="contribución-nacionalmente-determinada">Nationally Determined Contribution 2020</h1>
<blockquote>
  Costa Rica presents the following information in accordance with its responsibilities under paragraphs 24 and 25 of decision 1 / CP.21 to communicate or update its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to 2020.
</blockquote>
<p>This 2020 Nationally Determined Contribution is informed by public policy instruments created in Costa Rica after the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and the respective ratification in 2016, and is therefore influenced by the commitments made there.</p>
<p>Since submitting its first Nationally Determined Contribution, Costa Rica has developed a new legal and institutional framework for climate action. The two pillars in adaptation and mitigation, respectively, are the National Adaptation Policy presented in 2018 and the National Decarbonization Plan presented in 2019 as the Long-Term Strategy (ELP) under the Paris Agreement. Thus, this contribution is explicitly related to the Long-Term Strategy.</p>
<p>Costa Rica recognizes that to achieve sustainable development, including a decarbonized, adapted and resilient economy, it is essential to close the social gaps that afflict the country.</p>
<p>It also recognizes that the best way to close these gaps is by taking advantage of the competitive advantages it has to continue leading the global transition towards decarbonization and resilience, and to do so in the spirit of solidarity, multilateralism and inclusiveness that has characterized its greatest historical victories.</p>
<p>Finally, it recognizes that being a deep decarbonization laboratory at the country level is also the greatest contribution that the country can make to the global effort to keep the increase in world temperature in this century well below 2°C above the pre-industrial levels, and continue efforts to further limit the temperature rise to 1.5°C.</p>
<p>By virtue of the foregoing, Costa Rica intends to demonstrate fair, adapted and resilient decarbonization as the way to achieve the best version of our country in terms of economic reactivation in the short term and general well-being in the medium and long term, allowing us to fully satisfy the rights human beings of all people within the limits of the planet and prosper in balance.</p>

<h2 id="i.">i.Headline goals in mitigation</h2>
<ul><li><p>Costa Rica commits to an absolute maximum of net emissions by 2030 of 9.11 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), including all gases and all sectors covered by the corresponding National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. This goal is consistent with the trajectory of the National Decarbonization Plan, the Long-Term Strategy presented by Costa Rica in 2019 and that seeks net zero emissions in 2050 and is consistent with the trajectory of 1.5C.</p></li>
<li><p>Costa Rica commits to a maximum budget of net emissions in the period 2021 to 2030 of 106.53 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), including all gases and all sectors covered by the corresponding National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases.</p></li></ul>
<h2 id="ii.">ii.Headline goal in adaptation</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Costa Rica is committed to strengthening the country's social, economic and environmental resilience conditions to the effects of climate change, through the development of capacities and information for decision-making, the inclusion of adaptation criteria in financing and planning instruments, the adaptation of public services, productive systems and infrastructure, and the implementation of nature-based solutions.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Based on paragraph 11 of Article 7 of the Paris Agreement, and following the indications of Decision 9 / CMA.1 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Costa Rica has decided to develop its National Communication on Adaptation as part of this NDC in Section V.</p></li></ul>

<p>Costa Rica has decided that it will send a formal communication to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in two moments. This document constitutes the first, in which the NDC and its main goals for a more ambitious commitment are made official and aligned with the National Decarbonization Plan and the National Adaptation Policy.

</p>
<p>A second communication will be sent before December 31 of the same year and will consist of a comprehensive document that disaggregates the specific climate action commitments by subject area, the Communication on Adaptation, and the Information for Clarity, Transparency and Understanding in accordance with relevant guides.</p>
