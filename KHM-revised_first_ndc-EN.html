<h2 id="foreword">Foreword </h2>
<p>The International community reached a truly historic milestone with the Paris climate agreement in 2015. Together, we agreed to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Cambodia has always been a strong supporter of multilateral action on climate change. As a country particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, we understand the urgency of ambitious climate action and aim to lead by example, in line with our capacities and responsibilities under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>
<p>The updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for Cambodia presents our commitments and needs for the next decade, in order to realize our vision of a low carbon and resilient society. Developed through extensive consultations over a nine-month period, our NDC includes contributions from all concerned stakeholders in the country, including relevant ministries and agencies, civil society representatives, development partners, academia, and the private sector.</p>
<p>The updated NDC has been improved in several important ways. First, coverage has increased to include climate change mitigation targets in the agricultural and waste sectors, and also with more detailed actions in key sub-sectors, such as energy efficiency. It includes a stronger set of adaptation actions, which remain the top priority for Cambodia. Second, we have set an ambitious target in the Forestry and Land Use sector (FOLU) for halving the deforestation rate by 2030, in line with our REDD+ strategy. In other sectors, we have increased our level of ambition for Green House Gases (GHG) emissions reduction compared to our initial NDC in 2015. Third, the updated NDC pays particular attention to gender and vulnerable groups, in order to ensure that our adaptation and mitigation actions contribute to a more inclusive society. Finally, a significant effort has been made to develop a solid framework for measurement, reporting and verification (MRV), so that we are able generate credible evidence on progress made and on challenges encountered. This will help us to keep refining our policies so that we not only meet our NDC commitments, but also our climate change targets under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners who have contributed to the development of this document, both at the sectoral and national levels. I would like to thank in particular the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance programme (funded by the European Union, Sweden, and UNDP), the World Bank, the NDC Partnership, and other Development Partners for their support and cooperation for this process.</p>
<p>As Cambodia is committed to doing her part to address the global challenge of climate change, we look forward to working with all our partners to address our remaining needs in financing, capacity development, and technology transfers. This cooperation and support will be crucial to achieve the ambitious vision set out in this document.</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary </h2>
<h3 id="chapter-1-introduction">Chapter 1: Introduction </h3>
<p>The International community reached a truly historic milestone with the Paris climate agreement in 2015. Together, we agreed to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, to significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) is committed to combating climate change and accelerating the transition to a climate-resilient, low-carbon sustainable mode of development. The RGC has supported global efforts against climate change by being a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 1996. Cambodia adopted and ratified the Paris Agreement by which the country submitted an ambitious Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which showcased her progress in climate policy, and put forward mitigation targets and adaptation actions consistent with her national circumstances. The country is now proud to submit an updated NDC, which strengthens her aspirations towards a cleaner and greener economy and fulfils her obligations to better the lives of her citizens, in particular the vulnerable.</p>
<p>The focus of Cambodia’s development is on reducing poverty and ensuring stable economic growth, with the aim of achieving upper-middle income status by 2030, as enshrined in the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). Cambodia is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and adaptation features prominently in the NDC. At the same time, Cambodia’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are increasing as the country develops. The country has already made remarkable progress in terms of climate change policy, particularly in mainstreaming climate change into national and sub-national planning. The RGC has developed and continues to implement the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014 – 2023 (CCCSP) (2013) and each relevant ministry has developed associated action plans (CCAPs). Cambodia’s first Biennial Update Report (BUR) was submitted in August 2020, and the Third National Communication (TNC) work is underway. The National Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Framework for the response to Climate Change has also been developed and regular climate public expenditure reviews have been undertaken.</p>
Cambodia has also improved the tracking of climate finance in her Official Development Assistance (ODA) database, among many other initiatives.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-mitigation">Chapter 2: Mitigation </h3>
<p>This section contains an illustration of Cambodia’s Business as Usual (BAU), the proposed mitigation targets and measures to support the achievement of them.</p>
<h4>Business as Usual (BAU) emission scenarios</h4>
<p>In the BAU scenario, overall GHG emissions in 2030 without the FOLU are expected to rise by up to 79 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year, while overall GHG emissions with the FOLU are expected to increase to 155 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year.</p>

<p>The FOLU sector will generate the highest overall BAU emissions in 2030, with 49.2% of the forecasted BAU emissions in 2030. This would be followed by the energy sector with 22.2%, the agricultural sector with 17.5%, and Industry (IPPU) with 9.0%.</p>
<h4>Mitigation targets</strong></h4>
<p>Using the information provided by relevant ministries on the mitigation measures, activities and assumptions, NDC scenarios for energy generation, transport, waste, industry, agriculture, and the building sectors were modelled using PROSPECT+, while NDC scenarios for the FOLU sector were developed using the EX-ACT tool.</p>
<p>The estimated emission reductions of the NDC scenario are shown below.</p>

<h4 id="mitigation-measures"><span class="underline">Mitigation measures</span> </h4>
<p>Mitigation actions were identified from information provided by the relevant ministries (MAFF, MISTI, MLMUPC, MME, MoE, MOEYs, MoT, MPWT, and NCDD) across seven mitigation sectors: energy, waste, industry, transport, agriculture, building, and the FOLU.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3-adaptation-contribution">Chapter 3: Adaptation contribution </h3>
<p>Adaptation features strongly in Cambodia’s initial NDC and is equally important in this updated NDC due to the country’s continued high vulnerability to climate change.</p>
<h4 id="cambodias-vulnerability-to-climate-change"><span class="underline">Cambodia’s vulnerability to climate change</span> </h4>
<p>Based on several international climate change indices, Cambodia is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change. The country is particularly vulnerable to floods, droughts, windstorms, and seawater intrusion. Climate change may reduce the country’s annual average GDP growth by 6.6% and absolute GDP by 0.4% in 2020, by 2.5% in 2030, and up to 9.8% in 2050. This may delay reaching upper middle-income status by one year. Accordingly, Cambodia has begun working to develop a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) based on the National Adaptation Programme of Actions (NAPA).</p>
<h4 id="impacts-and-priorities-for-adaptation-and-resilience"><span class="underline">Impacts and priorities for adaptation and resilience</span> </h4>
<p>Cambodia’s vulnerability is characterised by frequent floods and irregular rainfall, coupled with an agrarian based economy, limited human and financial resources, insufficient physical infrastructure, and limited access to technologies. Socio-economic status, location, access to resources and technologies all influence Cambodian’s ability to manage climate impacts. Different social groups experience climate vulnerability differently, and women, children, the disabled, the elderly and other socially marginalised groups are often hit harder.</p>
<p>For the development of the SNC, climate change impacts and vulnerability were assessed for the most vulnerable sectors including agriculture and water resources, forestry, coastal zones, and human health.</p>
<h4 id="prioritised-adaptation-actions"><span class="underline">Prioritised adaptation actions</span> </h4>
<p>As with mitigation, all Line Ministries with adaptation relevance submitted their proposed priority actions (86 in total). The focus sectors, in line with the vulnerability of the country, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agriculture (17 actions)</li>
<li>Coastal zones (2 actions)</li>
<li>Energy (2 actions)</li>
<li>Human health (5 actions)</li>
<li>Industry (1 action)</li>
<li>Infrastructure – including roads, buildings and urban land use planning (15 actions)</li>
<li>Livelihoods, poverty and biodiversity (7 actions)</li>
<li>Tourism (3 actions)</li>
<li>Water resources (6 actions).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a number of Ministries play an enabling role to facilitate the implementation of actions within the NDC. Such actions can be divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education (4 actions)</li>
<li>Gender (6 actions)</li>
<li>Governance (2 actions)</li>
<li>Information (4 actions)</li>
<li>Knowledge sharing (1 action)</li>
<li>Policy and planning (12 actions)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-4-cross-cutting-areas">Chapter 4: Cross-cutting areas </h3>
<p>The initial NDC was developed quickly which made conducting far-reaching consultations challenging. As such, some crucial areas of climate change policy and implementation were not adequately analysed, namely Gender; Youth involvement; and engagement with the Private sector.</p>
<p>Regarding Gender, all sectors, especially waste and energy, are key to mitigation. For adaptation, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sectors are particularly important, and all ministries provided targets for women’s participation. Gender-balanced training and awareness material and the promotion of ‘women champions’ are key. Most Ministries included gender disaggregated targets of each action across these areas.</p>
<p>Regarding youth involvement, in mitigation there is a focus on energy, industry and transport. In adaptation, youth are especially involved in energy, industry, and transport. Also, beyond direct engagement in these sectors, children and youth play a critical role in the development, implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of climate actions across sectors.</p>
<p>With regard to private sector engagement, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are key to the industry, waste, and energy sectors. While the private sector is less prevalent than in mitigation sectors, there are strong opportunities, especially for smallholder farmers and foresters. In general, the private sector can provide inputs, knowledge, and finance.</p>
<p>It is also important to highlight an additional area related to Indigenous People. The Cambodian Constitution recognises that all Khmer citizens (including all indigenous people under the National Policy on the Development of Indigenous Peoples) are equal before the law regardless of race, colour, national origin, etc. During the NDC implementation and particularly for mitigation measures in the FOLU, the RGC will seek to promote the rights of indigenous people, specifically concerning land ownership. </p>
<h3>Chapter 5: Governance and Implementation Processes</h3>
<h4 id="the-ndc-update-process"><span class="underline">The NDC update process</span> </h4>
<p>The Department of Climate Change (DCC) of the General Secretariat of the National Council for Sustainable Development (GSSD) led a preliminary assessment of the NDC implementation and the identification of gaps, as well as the development of the corresponding NDC Roadmap and Stakeholder Engagement Plan. This ensured that the country was able to review her NDC targets by the COP 26 meeting and is expected to achieve her stated contributions by 2030.</p>

<p>The NDC update process was initiated with the relevant line ministries in March 2020 and included contributions from a number of development partner experts. A private sector event included the participation of stakeholders from a range of different sectors, and local communities and indigenous peoples were engaged in the process. Every effort was made to conduct consultations in a gender responsive way.</p>
<h4 id="overarching-policy-structures"><span class="underline">Overarching policy structures</span> </h4>
<p>Cambodia’s NDC places strong focus on the CCCSP 2014-23 (2013) and the related Sectoral Action Plans for its implementation. The following guidelines are also crucial: Cambodia’s Sustainable Development Goals (CSDGs) 2016-30 (2018); The National Strategic Plan on Green Growth (NSPGG) 2013-2030 (2013); The Rectangular Strategy IV (2018); The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2019-2023 (that is currently under development); The Circular Economy Strategy and Action Plan (also under development) sectoral policies; and the related strategies detailed in the Annex.</p>
<h4 id="stakeholder-roles-and-responsibilities"><span class="underline">Stakeholder roles and responsibilities</span> </h4>
<p>An illustration of the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder with regard to the NDC implementation is below.</p>
<p><em>Stakeholder roles and responsibilities</em></p>

<p><img src="KHM-NDC1_2.png"/></p>

<h3 id="chapter-6-means-of-implementation">Chapter 6: Means of Implementation </h3>
This section presents an overview of the means of implementation across finance, capacity building, and technology.</p>
<h4 id="finance"><span class="underline">Finance</span> </h4>
<p>Despite ongoing efforts, financial demands remain high. Future resource mobilisation will look towards a reasonable mix of national and international funds, in addition to market mechanisms, where appropriate, and in line with progress on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The total funding required for all mitigation actions is over US $ 5.8 billion. The FOLU, waste, and energy sector actions require the highest funding. Total funding required for all adaptation actions is just over US $ 2 billion. Infrastructure, water, and agriculture require the highest funding.</p>
<h4 id="barriers-and-capacity-needs"><span class="underline">Barriers and capacity needs</span> </h4>
<p>The NDC review identified the need for capacity building for the NDC implementation, especially for the NCSD/DCC, CCTWG, and sectoral (and sub-national) TWGs. In addition, each ministry submitted its own capacity building needs, which will require a strong international support.</p>
<h4 id="technology-needs-and-availability"><span class="underline">Technology needs and availability</span> </h4>
<p>Cambodia has developed a technology needs assessment for adaptation and mitigation, and technology needs also feature prominently in the sectoral climate change action plans. However, these are largely outdated so each ministry provided an action by action indication of technology needs and availability.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-7-transparency">Chapter 7: Transparency </h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The RGC’s approach to developing and operationalising its domestic measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems focuses on integration into the existing climate change M&amp;E framework structure of the CCCSP rather than setting up new layers of institutional structures.</p>
<h4 id="mrv-for-ndc-tracking"><span class="underline">MRV for NDC Tracking</span> </h4>
<p>Cambodia is putting significant emphasis on the development of an integrated and detailed MRV system that is also aimed at achieving implementation of the NDC. It will be made up of the following components (mitigation, adaptation, GHG inventory, support received, and the support needed).</p>
<p><em>Components of MRV for NDC tracking</em></p>
<p><img src="KHM-NDC1_3.png"/></p>
<p>The system will detail how monitoring will occur and how data will be managed, aggregated, and translated into reports, with a particular focus on gender and vulnerable groups. A simple, accessible online NDC tracking system will be developed and the tool will be made accessible through the website.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding</span> The NDC contains a summary in table format of such information.</p>
<h4 id="fairness-and-ambition"><span class="underline">Fairness and ambition</span> </h4>
<p>Despite being a least developed country with an eighth of the per capita emissions when compared to the global average, with this NDC Cambodia is proposing an ambitious set of sectoral reduction targets and structured and comprehensive adaptation actions.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-8-sustainable-development">Chapter 8: Sustainable Development </h3>
<p>Climate change mitigation and adaptation will be crucial not only to achieve SDG 13 on Climate Action, but a range of other SDGs and the Paris Agreement, given the cross-cutting nature of climate change. SDG 13 has significant implications on the achievement of other key priorities of each country, such as poverty reduction, food security, gender equality, water and sanitation, energy access, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities, and sustainable land use and ecosystems<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. As part of the Cambodia NDC revision process, an analysis on how the NDCs can impact the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was carried out. Each mitigation measure and adaptation action has been screened against the attainment of the SDGs.</p>

<p>Cambodia’s development focus is on poverty reduction and stable economic growth, to support the country’s efforts to become an upper middle-income nation by 2030. To meet this aim, the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) prioritises: (1) investment in rural areas; (2) decentralisation of national governance; and (3) further integration into the ASEAN region and the wider international community.</p>
<p>Cambodia is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and adaptation features prominently in the NDC. The sectors most affected are agriculture, infrastructure, forestry, human health, and coastal zone areas are particularly vulnerable to sea level rises and intrusion. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Cambodia was ranked as the 12th most climate risk-prone country globally, showing the high-level of vulnerability to extreme weather events. However, beyond extreme weather events, climate change also results in slow-onset events that can have significant negative implications for Cambodia and her citizens, particularly the most vulnerable people. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier and its impacts are particularly damaging given the limited adaptive capacity of Cambodia’s population due to socioeconomic conditions such as poverty, malnutrition, agricultural dependence, settlements in flood-prone areas, and public health<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Cambodia’s total annual net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rising due to development activities. Hence, there is a need to prioritise developing Cambodia’s economy and improving the socioeconomic wellbeing of its population, including the most vulnerable people, through low-carbon pathways.</p>
<p>Cambodia has already made remarkable progress in climate change policy, especially in mainstreaming climate change into national and sub-national planning. The Cambodian Government’s coordinated strategy to tackle climate change is focused on adaptation, with a gradual increase in mitigation actions aligned with economic development goals. Cambodia has developed and continues to implement the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014 – 2023 (CCCSP) (2015) and each relevant ministry has developed associated action plans (CCAPs).</p>
<p>The country submitted her Intended NDC to the UNFCCC ahead of the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 in Paris in 2015 and then ratified the NDC in 2016. Cambodia’s first Biennial Update Report (BUR) was also completed and submitted in August 2020 and the Third National Communication (TNC) work is underway. Further submissions of the NDCs will enable the Cambodian Government to progress in the fulfilment of the Paris Climate Agreement. The successful implementation of Cambodia’s NDC will, however, rely on adequately accessing and mobilising domestic and international climate finance.</p>
<p>Cambodia has also made strong progress in developing and implementing monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) frameworks, including for finance. The country has produced regular climate public expenditure reviews and has improved tracking of climate finance in her Official Development Assistance (ODA) database. The National M&amp;E Framework for Climate Change Response has also been developed and future adaptation and mitigation efforts are anticipated to be supported by international donors and multilateral funds, as well as national contributions.</p>
<h2> Outline of the Document </h2>
<p>This document contains Cambodia’s updated NDC, in alignment with the UNFCCC’s decisions. Cambodia’s INDC, submitted in 2015 and ratified in 2016, already contains mitigation targets and adaptation actions until 2030, so this document updates the initial submission.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the document is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 2 contains the mitigation contribution,</li>
<li>Section 3 illustrates the adaptation contribution,</li>
<li>Section 4 includes cross-cutting areas of gender, youth involvement, and private sector engagement,</li>
<li>Section 5 contains governance and implementation processes,</li>
<li>Section 6 includes the means of implementation,</li>
<li>Section 7 contains an illustration of transparency means across mitigation, adaptation, and finance, and</li>
<li>In Section 8, the relationship between Cambodia’s NDC and sustainable development is presented.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mitigation-contribution">2 Mitigation Contribution </h3>
<p>This section contains an illustration of Cambodia’s Business as Usual (BAU), the proposed mitigation targets and measures to support the achievement of these targets.</p>
<h3> Business as Usual emission scenarios </h3>
<p>BAU scenarios were developed covering energy generation, transport, waste, industry, agriculture, building, and the forestry and other land use (FOLU) sectors. The BAU scenarios for electricity, transport, buildings, cement, other industries (excluding cement), agriculture, and waste sectors were developed using the PROSPECT+ model. The FOLU sector was formed based on the model developed for the REDD+ NDC assessment by the REDD+ Technical Secretariat (RTS).</p>
<p>Overall GHG emissions (including the FOLU) were validated using GHG emission values in the latest Biennial Update Report (BUR, 2020), which consists of GHG emissions from 2010 - 2016 for most of the sectors (except the FOLU). As shown in Table 1, the UNFCCC sectors were generated by combining certain PROSPECTS+ sectors.</p>

<h2> Mitigation Targets </h2>
<p>Using the information provided by relevant ministries on the mitigation measures, activities, and assumptions, NDC scenarios for energy, transport, waste, industry, agriculture, and the building sectors were modelled using PROSPECT+, while the NDC scenarios for the FOLU sector were developed using the EX-ACT tool.</p>
<p>The majority of targets identified below are conditional on the international support. Cambodia also implements mitigation actions under the country’s sustainable development programme. The start and end year of each project were considered as 2020 and 2030, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Overall GHG emission reductions including the FOLU</strong></p>
<h4 id="ndc-scenarios">NDC Scenarios </h4>
<p>The FOLU NDC Scenario: Reduce 50% of historical emissions by 2030 (REDD+ programme); This target is based on the REDD+ national strategy which was included due to recommendations from the REDD+ Technical Secretariat (RTS) and the Department of Climate Change. The main assumption of the calculation was to reduce the 50% historical emission from the forest sector (76.3 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e) by 2030 (38.1 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e) with an average annual reduction of 21 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year. (Further information on the NDC scenarios is provided in Appendix 6). The estimated emission reductions under the NDC scenario are shown in Figure 8 below.</p>
<p><img src="KHM-NDC1_10.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 8 Overall GHG emission reduction (including the FOLU)</p>
<p>As per Figure 8, the estimated emission reductions with the FOLU by 2030 under the NDC scenario will be approximately 64.6 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year (41.7% reduction, of which 59.1% is from the FOLU).</p>
<p><strong>The NDC Scenario - contributions by different sectors</strong></p>

<p>The emissions reduction of 64.6 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year is expected by 2030. This is a 41.7 % reduction compared with the BAU case.</p>
<p>The FOLU is expected to provide the major share of 59.1% emission reduction by 2030. Other sectors like energy (21.3%), agriculture (9.6%), industry (IPPU) (9.1%), and waste (0.9%) are also expected to contribute significantly.</p>
<p>This approach will have a better resilience to failure in mitigation activities. One disadvantage of the involvement of many sectors could be the need for more experts in many fields. However, this could be considered as an opportunity to develop or strengthen Cambodia’s capacity.</p>
<p>Mitigating emissions from the electricity sector will be directed mainly on the renewable energy power generation. There will be barriers imposed by the availability and the absorption capacity of the grid, which would have to be addressed for the achievement of targets.</p>
<p>Mitigating the transport sector emissions would require policy instruments and carbon pricing instruments to promote low emission transport modes. Social acceptance would depend on the chosen approaches, public awareness-raising activities, and the instruments used.</p>
<p>The other industrial sector will expand and play a major role during Cambodia’s development. Therefore, the energy efficiency and process development of existing as well as new industries will have to be improved in order to minimize the effect on emissions. As the cost of the RE is on the reducing trend use of the renewable energy will be a cost-effective mitigation strategy.</p>
<h2> Mitigation measures </h2>
<p>The Department of Climate Change (DCC) of the GSSD, supported by the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance (CCCA), has been coordinating stakeholder engagement and collecting submissions from line ministries on priorities for the NDC revision for both mitigation and adaptation activities. The template used to ensure comparability across mitigation actions is the following.</p>
<p>Table 7 Template for ministerial submissions for Mitigation Projects</p>
<p><img src="KHM-NDC1_12.png"/></p>
<p>Mitigation actions were identified from the NDC related information provided by the relevant ministries (MAFF, MISTI, MLMUPC, MME, MoE, MOEYs, MoT, MPWT, and NCDD). These projects were filtered and a list of mitigation projects was prepared. The mitigation projects are distributed among seven sectors: energy, waste, industry, transport, agriculture, building, and the FOLU. Table 8 shows the identified list.</p>

<h2 id="adaptation-contribution">3 Adaptation Contribution </h2>
<p>Adaptation features strongly in Cambodia’s initial NDC and is equally important in this updated NDC, due to the country’s continued high vulnerability to climate change.</p>
<h3> Cambodia’s vulnerability to climate change </h3>
<p>According to several international climate change indices, Cambodia is one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse impacts of climate change<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. The Global Climate Risk Index (1999–2018)<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> placed Cambodia at 12th place among the most vulnerable countries globally. The World Risk Index (2019)<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, calculated as a product of exposure and vulnerability, categorised Cambodia as among the ‘very high’ impacted countries.</p>
<p>Rising temperatures are likely to lead to increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in a fragile socio-economic context. The country's climate vulnerability results in loss and damage to human life, livelihoods, and the national economy, as well as the degradation of her natural resources. The country is particularly vulnerable to floods, droughts, windstorms, and seawater intrusion. According to a series of vulnerability assessments carried out in 2016<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, 17.5% of Cambodia’s communes were ‘highly’ vulnerable (i.e. 288 communes) and 27.28% (449 communes) were ‘quite’ vulnerable to multiple climate change hazards<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Notably, recent research<sup>8</sup> indicates that without climate change, the real GDP will grow at an average of 6.9% per year from 2017 to 2050, achieving Upper Middle-Income Country (UMIC) status in 2035. With climate change, the headline projections use the mid-climate change scenario and a mid-adaptation scenario that is equivalent to current levels of adaptation. Climate change reduces average GDP growth to 6.6% and absolute GDP by 0.4% in 2020, 2.5% in 2030, and 9.8% in 2050. As a result, the UMIC status may be delayed by one year. Accordingly, Cambodia has begun developing her National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The NAP process builds on work carried out as part of the National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA), the Second National Communication (SNC) and the CCSAP, among others. The NAP identifies climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation actions for Cambodia.</p>
<h3> Impacts and priorities for adaptation and resilience </h3>
<p>Cambodia’s vulnerability is characterised by frequent flooding and irregular rainfall, coupled with an agrarian based economy, limited human and financial resources, insufficient physical infrastructure, and limited access to technologies. Socio-economic status, as well as location, access to resources and technology all influence Cambodia’s ability to manage the impact of climate change. Different social groups experience climate vulnerability differently and women, children, the disabled, the elderly and other socially marginalised groups often feel the impacts of climate change disproportionately.</p>
<p>For the development of the SNC<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, climate change impacts and vulnerability were assessed for the most vulnerable sectors, namely agriculture and water resources, forestry, coastal zones, and human health.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agriculture and water resources:</strong> Under future climate conditions (2025 and 2050), most of Cambodia’s agricultural areas will be exposed to higher risks of drought. Based on data from the past 20 years, losses in production were mainly due to flooding (about 62%) and drought (about 36%). Most flooding occurs due to increased water levels in the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake between early July and early October. Disruptions to logistical corridors caused by floods have a profound impact to agricultural supply chains, both domestically and for international trade. The impact of climate change on yield is quite significant. Under the high emission scenario (SRES-A2)<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, wet season rice yield (rain-fed) is continuously expected to decrease until 2080 and could fall by up to 70% of current yield levels. Similarly, for the dry season, (irrigated) rice yields for crops planted in November and December could decrease by 40%. The negative impacts on agricultural production can lead to breakdown of food systems, and vulnerable groups risk further deterioration into food and nutrition crises if exposed to extreme climate events. Adaptation strategies, for example additional time in sourcing water or pasture, can particularly affect women labour allocation, in turn influencing time available for childcare and feeding (e.g. breastfeeding exclusively, preparing healthy meals). Further strain on the workload of women and climate change related stress during pregnancy could contribute to low birth weight, leading to increases in risks of undernutrition and non-communicable diseases<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>
<li><strong>Forestry</strong>: More than 4 million hectares of lowland forest, especially those located in the northeast and southwest, which currently have a water deficit period of between four and six months, will become exposed to a water deficit period of between six and eight months or more. A decrease in forest cover may in turn have negative implications for the population, especially children, through micronutrient deficiencies<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>. Moreover, decreased forest cover, either from climate change or deforestation, increases the risk of landslides<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>
<li><strong>Coastal zones:</strong> Rising sea levels are expected to impact coastal systems through inundation, flood and storm damage, loss of wetlands, erosion, saltwater intrusion, and rising water tables. Analysis of the impact of sea-level rises on coastal areas suggests that a total area of about 25,000 ha would be permanently inundated by a sea level rise of one metre, increasing to 38,000 ha at a sea level rise of two metres. Under a high emissions scenario, and without large investments in adaptation, an annual average of 30,700 people are projected to be affected by flooding due to sea level rises between 2070 and 2100<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. Cambodia also faces inland river flood risks. It is projected that by 2030 an additional 69,800 people may be at risk of river floods annually as a result of climate change, above the estimated 89,700 annually affected population in 2010.</p></li>


<li><strong>Human health:</strong> Under a high emissions scenario, the mean annual temperature is projected to rise by about 4.2°C on average from 1990 to 2100. This will negatively impact the most vulnerable populations, especially children and the elderly, particularly through heatwaves<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>. Higher temperatures and variable precipitation accelerates microbial growth, transmission and virulence, can lead to changes in the seasonal and geographic distribution of vector-borne and water-borne diseases<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>. The spatial pattern of malaria risk in Cambodia has been found to change as rainfall and temperature change in the future. The transmission risk tends to increase until 2050, and then decreases again in 2080<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>. High temperature and precipitation changes can also result in lower food production in the tropics as well as heat-related diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the SNC highlighted gaps in information on the role of ecosystems and natural protection assets such as soils, forests, coral reefs, and sea grasses in preventing losses due to climate change, as well as helping to build adaptive capacity.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s adaptation contribution follows the planning and implementation cycle of the NAP process and integrates elements that are specific to the NDC.</p>

<p>Source: Ministries’ submissions</p>
<h2 id="cross-cutting-areas">4 Cross-cutting areas </h2>
<p>The initial NDC was developed in a short period of time, which made far-reaching consultations challenging. As such, it was understood that some crucial areas of climate change policy and implementation were not adequately analysed, specifically <strong>1) Gender; 2) Youth involvement; and 3) Private sector engagement.</strong> Most Ministries included the implications of each action across these areas. These are presented and summarised below. It is also important to highlight an additional area related to <strong>Indigenous People</strong>. The Cambodian Constitution recognises that all Khmer citizens (which include indigenous people under the National Policy on the Development of Indigenous Peoples) are equal before the law regardless of race, colour, national origin, etc. Indigenous people are also protected by the Land Law (2001), the Forest Law (2002), the Protected Areas Law (2008), and the National REDD+ Strategy, among others. During the NDC implementation and particularly for mitigation measures in the FOLU, the RGC will seek to promote the rights of indigenous peoples, specifically concerning land ownership. Respect for the traditional knowledge held by indigenous peoples is integral to an understanding of traditional livelihoods and of culture and is, therefore, an essential component of safeguarding these rights.</p>
<h3>Gender </h3>
<h4> Overview </h4>
<p>Climate change affects gender minorities disproportionately, including women and girls. The areas where women play a central role - food security, nutrition, energy, livelihoods, health, natural resource management, among others - are those most directly impacted by climate change. By exaggerating gender inequality, climate change also reinforces a structural root cause of violence against women and girls<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In prioritising climate solutions, a gender-balanced approach should incorporate the intersectional needs of the population to ensure inclusivity. Addressing gender inequalities is, therefore, a priority for Cambodia and gender has been effectively mainstreamed across planning and budgeting, including in the context of addressing climate change.</p>
<p>Notably, the CCCSP includes a strategic objective to ‘<em>reduce sectoral, regional, gender vulnerability and health risks to climate change impacts</em>’. The Ministry mandated with planning and facilitating the implementation of gender issues is the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MOWA). The MOWA has formed a Gender and Climate Change Committee, which gathers information on gender and climate change, conducts studies on the impact of climate change on women and children and builds climate change capacity in the ministry’s departments. The MOWA has also integrated climate change, green growth, and disaster risk management into Neary Rattanak IV, the National Policy on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment. In addition, as part of Cambodia’s periodic reporting to the Convention on Ending all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Cambodia National Council for Women (CNCW) responds specifically to the disproportionate impacts of climate change on rural women and acknowledges the policy and programme efforts underway in Cambodia to mitigate these impacts<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As part of this NDC update, all Ministries acknowledged the importance of addressing gender issues, particularly women’s participation in climate action. Most priority actions have a specific target for women’s participation that ranges from 15% to 70%. Gender and age disaggregated data are crucially important in measuring the success of the gender targets, not only related to women’s participation but also women’s access to skills and technology, as well as women in climate-related decision making.</p>
<h4>Mitigation </h4>
<p>Mitigation priority actions, including energy, waste, and transport, all have linkages to gender equality and social inclusion and the potential to contribute to several gender-based indicators. In relation to energy priorities such as (1) access to energy in rural areas and (2) the diversification of household and community energy generation sources to reduce reliance on biomass as an energy source, women are often responsible for household energyrelated decisions in rural areas, and women, the poor and the marginalised are often last to gain energy access. Gender-responsive mitigation actions and indicators will help measure these changes and also contribute to measuring the success of SDG 5, Cambodia’s CEDAW commitments, and the CCCSP.</p>
<p>All mitigation sectors have encouraged the equal involvement of men and women in mitigation actions. However, the waste and energy sectors show a higher tendency of maintaining a gender balance and encouraging women’s participation. For example, women and children often constitute a large portion of informal waste pickers. Therefore, formalising the waste sector management and creating decent jobs could have a significant impact on ensuring stable livelihoods for women. Projects such as those in the composting market can benefit both men and women.</p>
<p>There is high potential to contribute to gender equality through increasing energy access in rural areas, by diversifying household and community energy generation sources. For example, by reducing the reliance on biomass as an energy source. Women are also often responsible for the majority of household energy-related decisions in rural areas. Gender equality can be encouraged in mitigation actions such as through eco-payments.</p>
<p>In the transport sector, women generally use public transport more than men. Ensuring safe, efficient and comfortable transport for women may increase their access to higher education centres, skills development centres and other resources in urban areas.</p>
<p>Women constitute a higher proportion of the working population in agriculture, and the forestry sector is seen as providing strong opportunities to improve gender balance. In the forestry sector, and particularly for REDD+, there is a need to recognise the diversity of stakeholders, particularly among forest communities. In addition to continuing the enhancement of ‘invited spaces’ for women’s groups, it will be important for gender outcomes to be adequately captured in the country’s REDD+ Safeguards Information Systems and the broader REDD+ monitoring system.</p>
<h4>Adaptation </h4>
<p>Skilled agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers are the most common occupations (31%) among Cambodia’s working population<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a>. Women (32.5%) make up slightly more of the employed population than men (28.5%)<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>. This category, however, this does not account for the self-employed or those working their own land, which is very common in Cambodia’s agrarian-based economy. Women have a strong role to play in this sector and in value chain development in particular. Priorities include the need to increase women’s income generation while decreasing their work burden by improving agricultural practices and access to technology, as well as fostering women’s collective working groups.</p>
<p>In terms of infrastructure, particularly in climate proofing of buildings and roads, opportunities for women to contribute more prominently to restoration and construction are needed, in order to increase their access to income and livelihoods.</p>
<p>In the human health sector, the importance of gender-disaggregated data is considered a priority, especially to understand the different impacts of air-and vector-borne diseases on women and men. This is of particular significance to women, who often carry the burden of household care including medical care for the family, but who also play an important role in championing behavioural patterns which may improve health and hygiene and reduce disease spread<a href="#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a>. In Disaster Risk Management (DRM), little gender-disaggregated data collection exists, therefore information on the differentiated impacts of disasters on women, the elderly, children, disabled people, and other socially marginalised groups is largely anecdotal. Data collection needs to be prioritised and the role of women in DRM strengthened, particularly in the potential role women and children can play a key role in developing and monitoring emergency response plans.</p>
<h4>Enabling actions </h4>
<p>It is crucial to develop training and awareness materials that take particular gender-based needs and priorities into account to ensure that women and girls benefit equally from climate action. The training of trainers and ‘women champions’ are being rolled out in an effort to reach women in particular, and this work will be continued and scaled up where possible. The linkages between more targeted education and an increase in school enrolment for children, in particular girls, are also key to ensure the impacts of climate change do not disproportionately affect girls in terms of access to, and the completion of, education.</p>
<h3> Youth involvement </h3>
<h4> Overview </h4>
<p>The Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MoEYS) is the lead Ministry mandated with ensuring youth engagement in all relevant sectors, including in climate change. Some Ministries have indicated where youth engagement can be most appropriate.</p>
<h4> Mitigation </h4>
<p>The involvement of youth in mitigation actions tends to be lower than in adaptation. However, youth are encouraged to participate in programmes in the relevant sectors, including energy, industry, and transport.</p>
<h4> Adaptation </h4>
<p>In the infrastructure sector, youth could provide inputs in construction design, given their role as workers. In DRM they can promote and share knowledge of Early Warning Systems (EWS) with their communities. In human health and water resources (especially conservation), their role in awareness-raising campaigns is crucial. Youth also play a key role in the tourism sector, from working in eco-tourism to promoting local organic products. Youth are also a target of higher education abroad programmes, especially in the water resources sector. Overall, they can engage in volunteering activities related to education, training, and outreach and also through specific media programmes.</p>
<h4 > Enabling actions </h4>
<p>Beyond direct engagement in these sectors, children and youth play a critical role in the development, implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of climate actions across sectors – they need to be engaged at the national and local levels to participate meaningfully in the development of climate policies, including the NDC and NAP. They need to be empowered to be able to act as leaders of the next generation, educated on their environmental rights and equipped with the necessary skills, knowledge and training for a green transition.</p>
<h3>Private sector engagement </h2>
<h4 > Overview </h4>
<p>Most actions will be effective only through the engagement of the sector-appropriate private sector players, including through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Private sector entry points have been identified with most of the ministries, and engagement is highlighted in the NDC implementation through directed actions. Private sector partners will need to be engaged to develop PPPs for climate solutions, beyond a donor-based approach, that can be applied sector-wide.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges and opportunities for PPPs include<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>
:</p>
<ul>
<li>An absence of reliable data on private sector investments, including difficulties in identifying adaptation measures supported by the private sector and issues in covering all parts of the economy;</li>
<li>The size of the informal sector which accounts for more than half of Cambodia’s GDP; and</li>
<li>Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) make up the majority of businesses in Cambodia (only 0.2 % are companies with at least 100 employees; 98% of companies employ 10 people or fewer) and provide around two-thirds of the country’s employment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through addressing some of these challenges and opportunities, there is potential to accelerate climate action with the private sector through PPPs.</p>
<h4> Mitigation </h4>
<p>In general, all mitigation sectors require strong public and private sector collaboration to ensure effectiveness. Based on existing climate related data and information available, the private sector is predominantly involved in the industry, waste and energy sectors, while less information is available for other sectors, namely transport, forestry, and agriculture.</p>
<h4> Adaptation </h4>
<p>While the main potential to scale up private investments relate to mitigation efforts, barriers can be removed in order to stimulate private sector adaptation engagement, not least in the agriculture, human health, and fisheries sectors<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>
.</p>
<p>In all sectors, and crucially in buildings and infrastructure, it is in the interest of the private sector to be involved in policymaking and planning and to ensure guidelines and standards are appropriate and implementable. Private sector players are equally involved as input and technology providers (such as in innovative and more resilient clean energy, agriculture, and water spaces), as service providers (such as in eco-tourism or technical assistance to sectors such as water) or as financiers to many other actions, or can themselves be involved in awareness, training and education, such as through private media and universities.</p>
<h2>5 Governance and Implementation Processes </h2>
<h3> The NDC update process </h3>
<p>The Department of Climate Change (DCC) of the GSSD led a preliminary assessment of the NDC implementation and identification of gaps, as well as the development of the corresponding NDC Roadmap and Stakeholder Engagement Plan. This ensured that the country was able to review her NDC targets by the COP 26 meeting and is expected to achieve her stated contributions by 2030.</p>
<p>The process for the formulation of the NDC roadmap allowed for an initial engagement of stakeholders in key sectors in the discussion of which resources and mechanisms could be leveraged and what would still need to be put in place to ensure full delivery of the NDC targets. The NDC Roadmap, with expected timelines and targets for Cambodia’s NDC implementation, as emerged from the process detailed above, is presented below.</p>

<p>Figure 11 Summary of the NDC implementation timeline and targets</p>
<p>Source: NDC Roadmap (2019)</p>
<p>The NDC update process initiated with the line ministries in March 2020 helped ascertain whether certain targets would need to be adjusted and whether Cambodia would be able to raise her level of ambition. Strong engagement continued throughout the process: experts from development partners, including UNWOMEN, FAO, UNDP, UNICEF, World Bank, GGGI, and WHO provided specialist advice both to line ministries and inputting directly in this document. In addition, a private sector event was organised, with wide participation of stakeholders from different sectors, and local communities and indigenous peoples have been engaged in the process. Every effort was made to conduct such consultations in a gender responsive way.</p>
<h3>Overarching policy structures </h3>
<p>Cambodia’s NDC places strong focus on the CCCSP 2014-23 (2013) and related Sectoral Action Plans for its implementation, in addition to the following, some of which have been developed since 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cambodia’s Sustainable Development Goals (CSDGs) 2016-30 (2018) have been developed, adapting the global SDGs to Cambodia’s context by adding ‘Goal 18 of Demining’ and tailoring the indicators</li>
<li>The National Strategic Plan on Green Growth (NSPGG) 2013-2030 (2013) was prepared to move Cambodia towards a green economy</li>
<li>The Rectangular Strategy IV (2018) was developed, focusing on fostering socioeconomic development</li>
<li>National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2019-2023 was developed. There are four climate change indicators in the current NSDP. The line ministries will be required to develop their own sectoral development plans; and</li>
<li>The Circular Economy Strategy and Action Plan is also being advanced. This outlines the key vision, mission, strategies, and roadmap for Cambodia to transition towards a circular economy through the improvement of many aspects of the economy and society.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are a number of other sectoral policies and strategies, detailed action by action in the Annexes, including the below:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Protected Area Strategic Management Plan 2017-2031 (2017)</li>
<li>National Cooling Plan (draft)</li>

<h3> Stakeholder roles and responsibilities </h3>
<p>The <strong>NCSD</strong> is the focal point for the UNFCCC, in addition to covering a number of other roles. The DCC/GSSD has played a key role in coordination within the government, integration into planning and budgeting, in addition to capacity building and overall stakeholder engagement across all sectors. The NCSD promotes sustainable development aimed at ensuring economic, environmental, social, and cultural balance within the Kingdom of Cambodia. It also includes an Executive Committee and a Secretariat (housed at the Ministry of Environment).</p>
<p>A <strong>General Secretariat (GSSD)</strong> was established to support the operations of the NCSD and for coordinating the development of policies, strategic plans, action plans, and legal instruments concerning sustainable development, including the green economy, climate change, biodiversity conservation and biosafety, and science and technology.</p>
<p>The <strong>Department of Climate Change (DCC)</strong> is under the GSSD and has led technical efforts for climate change adaptation and mitigation response and reporting.</p>
<p>A <strong>Climate Change Technical Working Group (CCTWG)</strong> was established to facilitate and provide technical support to the National Council for Sustainable Development (NCSD) in addressing climate change in the Kingdom of Cambodia. The TWG is key to governance and to ensure decision making and implementation by key line ministries.</p>
<p><strong>Committees or technical working groups</strong> have been created in several line ministries to take on the coordination responsibilities for climate change actions within their respective sectors.</p>
<p>Civil society is recognised as an important voice for the community and plays an important role in policy implementation. The <strong>NGO Forum</strong> is one way in which civil society can bring a voice to the NDC formulation and implementation. Development partners also provide a platform for NGO collaboration and women-focused NGOs were consulted during the process of this NDC update.</p>
<p>An illustration of the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder in relation to the NDC implementation can be seen in the following table.</p>

<h2 id="means-of-implementation">7 Means of Implementation </h2>
<p>This section presents an overview of the means of implementation across finance, capacity building, and technology.</p>
<h3>Finance </h3>
<p>Despite ongoing efforts, financial needs remain high and most actions require financial support (detailed actions are listed in the Annexes). Future resource mobilisation will look towards a reasonable mix of national and international funds, in addition to market mechanisms, where appropriate, and in line with progress on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The NDC Roadmap indicated that Cambodia will also require the development of a climate investment plan to aggregate finance needs, gaps, sources, options, and the creation of a project pipeline.</p>
<h4> Mitigation </h4>
<p>The following table summarises the finance needs per sector as reported by each ministry in their mitigation submissions. The total funding required for mitigation actions is over <strong>US $ 5.8 billion.</strong> The FOLU, waste, and energy sector mitigation actions require the most funds. These are mostly conditional upon international support. (Further information is provided in Appendix 4).</p>

<p>Of the amount indicated above, the majority is conditional upon international support. In fact, almost half of the actions specifically included an indication of conditionality, whilst only five specified that implementation may be possible, at least partially, through existing budget allocations (see detailed table in Appendix 2). In any case, more analysis will need to be carried out as part of the NDC tracking process to ensure transparency.</p>
<h3> Barriers and capacity needs </h3>
<p>The NDC review identified the need for capacity building for the NDC implementation, especially for the NCSD/DCC, CCTWG, and sectoral (and sub-national) TWGs. In addition, each ministry submitted its own capacity building requirements. The table below summarises the barriers and capacity needs for the NDC implementation as submitted by each ministry and identified in the NDC review, the tackling of which will require strong international support.</p>

<h3>Technology needs and availability </h3>
<h4> Overview </h4>
<p>Cambodia has developed a technology needs assessment for adaptation and mitigation. Technology needs also feature prominently in the sectoral climate change action plans.</p>
<p>However, these are mostly out of date, as such, each ministry provided an action by action indication of technology needs and availability (see the Annexes) and summarised here.</p>
<h4>Mitigation </h4>
<p>Limited information has been provided on technology availability in mitigation sectors. In waste, required technology is available in the country and region (e.g. Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia). In the energy sector, technologies such as Solar Home Systems (SHS), direct and alternating current (AC/DC) micro grids, and solar battery charging stations are available in the country. In the agricultural sector for example, compost technology is currently available. Key technologies in the transport sector include digital systems for GHG emission MRV; spatial planning tools for network management, including traffic management and newer technologies for electric mobility.</p>
<h4>Adaptation </h4>
<p>The agricultural sector indicated detailed technology needs for climate smart practices in all its proposed actions, ranging from stress tolerant varieties, to systems of rice intensification to integrated pest management and integrated soil and nutrient management. There are a number of innovative information platforms and databases in use for disaster risk management, including CAMDI (to monitor the impact of disasters, and the DesInventar package), real-time technology-based weather forecasting methods and technology transferred from the French and Finnish meteorological societies, in addition to manuals and toolkits such as the Community Based Disaster Risk Management Field Practitioners Handbook and the KoBo toolbox for community assessment. The energy sector continues to adapt renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the Cambodian context. The health sector makes use of a number of systems, such as the National Dengue Surveillance System, or the CAMEWARN, a case-based surveillance system which covers seven epidemic prone diseases and syndromes. The infrastructure sector makes use of several guidelines for climate proofing investment developed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. Technologies in use in the land use planning sector include land survey high technology, aerial photography for mapping, soil tests for spatial planning, downscaled climate projections and network-level vulnerability assessments. In the water resources sector, groundwater analysis, vulnerability and risk assessments, in addition to groundwater monitoring systems are in use.</p>
<h4>Enabling technologies </h4>
<p>The enabling sectors use a range of known technologies including radio, TV and social media for information and awareness to sharing lessons learned from other countries, or the National M&amp;E Manual to monitor progress on indicators.</p>
<h2 id="transparency">8 Transparency </h2>
<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>The RGC’s approach to developing and operationalising its domestic measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems focuses on integration into the existing climate change M&amp;E framework structure of the CCCSP rather than setting up new layers of institutional structures.</p>

<p><img src="KHM-NDC1_15.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 13 MRV systems in Cambodia</p>
  <p> Source: NCSD (2020)</p>
<p>Cambodia has made significant efforts in establishing robust information systems for MRV. The country has five well-established MRV systems (GHG emissions, CCCSP, which includes adaptation and mitigation, REDD+, Project level MRVs for two planned Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), 12 Clean Development Mechanism (CDMs), 6 Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCMs), and 6 Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs) and Support received).</p>
<h3> MRV for NDC Tracking </h3>
<p>Cambodia puts great emphasis on the development of an integrated and detailed MRV system, which is also aimed at achieving the implementation of the NDC. It will be comprised of the following components (mitigation, adaptation, GHG inventory, support received, and support needed).</p>
<p><img src="KHM-NDC1_16.png"/></p><p>Figure 14 Components of MRV for NDC tracking</p>

<p>Source: NCSD (2020)</p>

<p>The system will detail how monitoring will happen, and how data will be managed, aggregated and translated into reports, with particular attention paid to gender and vulnerable groups. A simple, accessible and understandable <strong>NDC tracking online system</strong> will be developed and the tool will be made accessible online. It is expected that, to the extent possible, the system will harmonise and track all data needs for the relevant international agencies and domestic stakeholders. It will serve as a data repository for in-country stakeholders, including to provide knowledge management for the private sector and to track their contributions to the SDGs, and international ones, particularly the UNFCCC and any other relevant international reporting agency. Verification from third parties, including academic institutions, will be considered.</p>
<p>The system will also consider the ISAF (accountability framework) supported by the NCDD (financed by the WB). This ensures proper accessibility of information at the community level (Information for Citizens I4C) and accountability at the commune levels to follow-up on the proposed measures.</p>

Tier 1 methodologies set out in the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines and IPCC default emission factors and country specific activity data from 1994 to 2016 were used for the BAU assessment.</p>
<p>Baseline Scenario: Projections were generated by forecasting the calculated emissions within the period of 2000 to 2016 using PROSPECT+ modelling tool for electricity, transport, buildings, cement, other industry (excluding cement), agriculture and waste sectors. Default emission factors and activity data were collected from a wide range of sources but focusing mainly on the latest update of BUR and the defaults values which were given by the model itself.</p>
<p>All projections considered current macroeconomic conditions, policy conditions, market conditions and events in other sectors. For each sector, a BAU scenario was developed by extrapolating past emission trends, interpolating to fill data missing in a sequence and using relevant influential factors (GDP, population, forestry growth rate).</p>
<p>Mitigation Scenario: These were formulated based on submissions from relevant ministries. All the possible mitigation actions were considered to develop the NDC scenario using PROSPECT+ model.</td>

<h3> Fairness and ambition </h3>
<p>The core mitigation commitments of the Paris Agreement are common to all parties, but there is some differentiation in requirements. Developed countries “<em>should</em>” undertake absolute economy-wide reduction targets, while developing countries “<em>are encouraged</em>” to move toward economy-wide targets over time. Cambodia, despite being a least developed country, with an eighth of the per capita emissions when compared to the global average<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>
, sets, in this updated NDC, ambitious sectoral reduction targets and structured and comprehensive adaptation actions.</p>
<h2 id="sustainable-development">9 Sustainable Development </h2>
<p>Climate change mitigation and adaptation will be crucial not only to achieve SDG 13 on Climate Action, but a number of other SDGs, in addition to the Paris Agreement and given the cross-cutting nature of climate change. SDG 13 has significant implications on the achievement of other key priorities of each country, such as poverty reduction, food security, gender equality, water and sanitation, energy access, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities, and sustainable land use and ecosystems<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>
. As such, the NDC implementation can contribute to almost all SDGs, and gender sensitive approaches can help redress gender inequalities (SDG5) and ensure women are engaged and can benefit at all levels.</p>
<p>As part of the Cambodia NDC revision process, an analysis on how the NDCs can impact the achievement of the SDG was carried out. Each mitigation measure and adaptation action was screened against the attainment of the SDGs. For mitigation, the SCAN tool was utilized.</p>
<p>Given the overlap between the SDGs and climate change action, the MRV/Transparency systems used for the NDC implementation can potentially be used to track the SDG implementation as well, especially the goals related to mitigation, adaptation, and finance. They could also be used to track the gender sensitive impact of climate actions and effectiveness of gender mainstreaming initiatives if appropriate gender indicators are embedded into the M&amp;E framework and appropriate resources and monitored.</p>

<li>GHG savings due to the anaerobic decomposition of carbon matter in the IWW and the inefficient running of treatment systems.</li>

<li>Less pollution of local waterways which may impact farmlands, especially in the dry season when the IWW is not diluted</li>
</ul></td>
<td>
<p>Due to the lack of available data, it is difficult to estimate current GHG emissions and therefore derive emission saving targets (this should be built into the project).</p>
<p>Assessment of methane production potential from IWW streams is depending on the concentration of degradable organic matter in the wastewater, the volume of wastewater, and the propensity of the industrial sector to treat their wastewater in anaerobic systems, or not treat it at all. One of the best ways to reduce GHG emission is to capture the methane generated by anaerobic IWW treatment processes. However, this can be only economically feasible for large scale operations. A study in China targeting IWW with a high concentration of organics treated with anaerobic systems indicated that the amount of gas recycled in 2010 was only 5.4% of total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. Therefore, a target of 5-10% for Cambodia may be realistic as a starting point. Other targets may include:</p>

<ul>

<p>1. Reduced energy and water costs at factories, by reduce water use and/or reuse treated wastewater </p>
<p>2. Improved air quality (odours) for workers and local populations</p>

<p>4. Provides job opportunities for the installation of WWTPs</p>
<p> 5. Opportunities to reuse the sludge, depending on the contamination profile</p>
</td>


<td>The total cost will depend on the number of factories targeted. Installing a new system is a net cost, but a basic system can be installed relatively
cost effectively for SMEs. Improvements of existing systems will be done according
to cost benefits analysis, aiming to work with factories that will save money. Overall, It could be aimed to set up a finance vehicle of USD 5-10 mn to support factories with cofinancing.</td>

<p>Without stronger measures to encourage the uptake of more efficient units, IEA estimates that rising electricity demand from cooling alone is projected to require around 200 GW of additional generation capacity in 2040 and cooling could be responsible for as much as 30% share in the ASEAN region’s peak electricity demand. Deploying more efficient ACs, along with other efficient equipment and building efficiency improvements, would permit ASEAN countries to save 110 TWh of electricity by 2040.

Management and
Mitigation is created
because the construction equipment operations consume a lot of natural resources, such as electricity and/or diesel fuel. 3. The measure includes enacting strict laws to enforce institutions to make environmental impact assessment (EIA) in the early stage of projects, and enhancing the awareness of construction participants with regard to impacts of
construction in the environmentThe results also revealed that "search about alternative methods for construction to mitigate the adverse impacts of construction on the environment" was ranked in the second position with regard to proposed solutions to mitigate the environmental

<h2 id="appendix-5-ndc-scenarios">Appendix 5: NDC Scenarios </h2>
<p>In all sectors except FOLU, there is only one NDC scenario. The FOLU sector has three NDC scenarios, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>FOLU NDC Scenario 1: 60% forest cover by 2030 – (MAFF, Rectangular Strategy IV). Increment of forest cover up to 60% of national land area was suggested by the MAFF. According to the received information, this target is agreed with the “Rectangular Strategy IV, angle 2 (60% of forest cover is maintained)”.</li>
<li>The FOLU NDC Scenario 2: Reduction 50% of historical emission by 2030 (REDD+ programme); This target is based on the REDD+ national strategy which was included due to the suggestions of REDD+ Technical Secretariat (RTS) and the Department of Climate Change. The main assumption of the calculation was to reduce historical emissions from the forest sector by half (76.3 million tCO2e) by 2030 (38.1 million tCO2e), with an average annual reduction of 21 million tCO2e/year.</li>
<li>The FOLU NDC Scenario 3: INDC emission reduction (INDC, 2015) - (4.7 tCO2e/ha/year).</li>
</ul>

<p>This scenario was based on the FOLU sector target presented in the country’s INDC report. The INDC target was also developed in the expectation of maintaining 60% forest cover of the total land area. However, the considered base year was 2010. The effort necessary to increase the forest cover was less (from 57% forest cover in 2010 to 60% in 2030. The increment is 3%). Therefore, emission reduction for the increasing 1 hectare of forest cover was estimated as 4.7 tCO2e/ha/year in INDC.</p>
<p>However, actual forest cover is around 42% in 2020. The 18% of forest cover increment should be applied to achieve 60% target in 2030. Here It was observed how much emission reduction can be achieved using the same emission factor value (4.7 tCO2e/ha/year) in the current circumstances.</p>

<p>The following three overall NDC scenarios were developed based on the three NDC scenarios of the FOLU sector:</p>
<ul>
<li>NDC Scenario 1: FOLU NDC scenario 1 combined with available NDC scenarios of other sectors</li>
<li>NDC Scenario 2: FOLU NDC scenario 2 combined with available NDC scenarios of other sectors</li>
<li>NDC Scenario 3: FOLU NDC scenario 3 combined with available NDC scenarios of other sectors</li>
</ul>
<p>Estimated emission reductions under the different NDC scenarios are shown in Figure 15 below.</p>
<p><img src="KHM-NDC1_63.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 15 Overall GHG emission reduction (including the FOLU)</p>
<p>Source: NCSD (2020)</p>
<p>As per Figure 15, the estimated emission reduction with FOLU by 2030 under different NDC scenarios will be approximately:</p>
<ul>
<li>NDC scenario 1: 329.2 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year (212.4 % reduction, of which 92% is from FOLU),</li>


<li>NDC scenario 2: 64.6 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year (41.7% reduction, of which 59.1% is from FOLU); and</li>
<li>NDC scenario 3: 30.2 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year (19.7 % reduction, of which 12.5% is from FOLU).</li>

<p>The NDC Scenario 1 has a mitigation target of 329.2 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year by the year 2030.</p>
<p>This is a 212.4 % reduction compared to the BAU scenario.</p>
<p>The FOLU is to provide the major share of 92% emission reduction by 2030. Other sectors like energy (4.2 %), agriculture (1.9%), industry (IPPU) (1.8 %), and waste (0.2 %) are also expected to contribute in a minor way.</p>
<p>The FOLU sector would contribute to 49.2% of the total GHG emissions of the country by 2030 and 61% by 2016.</p>
<p>However, this is a high national ambition. A main reason for the reduction of forest area is utilizing forest land for agriculture. Therefore, supporting policies such as increasing the yield of agricultural lands and possible interventions like forest gardens where a combination of large and small useful trees are planted in home gardens need to be explored in order to achieve this target without hindering the production of the agriculture sector.</p>

<p>Under the NDC scenario 2, an emission reduction of 64.6 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year is expected by 2030. This is a 41.7 % reduction compared with the BAU case.</p>
<p>Even under this scenario, the FOLU is expected to provide the major share of the 59.1% reduction in emissions by 2030. Other sectors like energy (21.3%), agriculture (9.6%), Industry (IPPU) (9.1%), and waste (0.9%) are also expected to contribute in a significant way.</p>
<p>This approach will have an even wider participation than scenario 1 and will have even better resilience to failures in the mitigation activities. Yet one disadvantage of the involvement of many sectors could be the need for more experts in many fields. However, this could be considered as an opportunity to develop or strengthen Cambodia’s capacity.</p>

<p>Under the NDC scenario 3, the target emission reduction is 30.2 million tCO<sub>2</sub>e/year by 2030, which is a 19.7 % reduction compared with the BAU scenario.</p>
<p>The main emphasis for emission reduction under this scenario is on the Energy sector (45.5%), followed by the Agriculture sector (20.6%). The Industry (IPPU) sector is at third place with a 19.5% expected contribution. The FOLU will also join with above sectors to make a more than 95% contribution in the emission reduction.</p>
<p>Placing less emphasis on the FOLU could be more socially acceptable as the rapid deforestation of the country would have been linked to the expansion of agriculture. Expecting a 20.6% share of emission reduction from agriculture also may be more acceptable to rural farming communities. However, there could be an effect on soil, water and other natural resources not considered in the GHG mitigation study.</p>
<p>Mitigating emissions from the electricity sector will be directed mainly on renewable energy power generation. There will be barriers imposed by the availability and the absorption capacity of the grid which would have to be addressed for the achievement of the targets.</p>
<p>Mitigating transport sector emissions would require policy instruments and carbon pricing instruments to promote low emission transport modes. Social acceptance would depend on the chosen approaches, public awareness and the instruments used.</p>
<p>The other industrial sectors will expand and play a major role during Cambodia’s development. Therefore, energy efficiency and the process of developing existing and new industries must be improved to minimize the effect on emissions. As the cost of the RE is on the reducing trend use of renewable energy will be a cost-effective mitigation strategy.</p>
<p>The RGC can decide on an NDC scenario to be followed based on the adaptability under the environmental, cultural, economic, technical and political conditions and priorities of the country.</p>

<p>Mitigation actions were identified from the NDC related information provided by the relevant ministries (MAFF, MISTI, MLMUPC, MME, MoE, MOEYs, MoT, MPWT, and NCDD). These projects were filtered and a list of mitigation projects was prepared. The mitigation projects are distributed among seven mitigation sectors: energy generation, waste, industry, transport, agriculture, building, and the FOLU. Table 22 shows the identified list.</p>
